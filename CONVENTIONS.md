This page identifies web site conventions and is intended for content editors.

It is copied from [GDC Website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/conventions-page)

## Web Site Grammar

*   Web Site content should be written in third-person (e.g. A researcher can...)
*   Spell out acronyms in the first reference to the acronym on a web page

## Web Site Punctuation

*   User only one space after each sentence (i.e. no double space after a period ".")

## Web Site Terminology

### General Terminology

*   Spell out the full organization name and/or program name followed by acronym in parentheses at the outset of a document or document section. After that point, use the acronym only without “the” in front of it. In general, “the” is not used before NCI or GDC. NCI GDC is not needed if content is posted on an NCI website. Use the possessive “NCI’s”  in a case such as “NCI’s goal is to provide genomic data…”, but using “GDC’s” is not appropriate. This form should not be used - there may be other ways to write content to avoid using this term.  (This guidance is from the NCI Office of Communications Public Laison - OCPL)

### GDC Tool Terminology

Use the following tool references

*   GDC Data Portal
*   GDC Data Transfer Tool
*   GDC Application Programming Interface for GDC API
*   GDC Data Submission Portal

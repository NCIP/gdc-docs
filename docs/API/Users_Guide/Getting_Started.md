# Getting Started

## The GDC Application Programming Interface (API): An Overview
The GDC API drives the GDC Data and Submission Portals. It is made available to external users for programmatic access to the functionality provided by the portals. This includes searching for, downloading, and submitting data and metadata.

The GDC API uses JSON as its communication format, and standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE`.

## Tools for communicating with the GDC API

Many third-party tools can be used for communicating with the GDC API and for preparing and visualizing API calls. The following is a non-exhaustive list.

Tools for communicating with the GDC API:

| Tool        | Type     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) 		| Command line tool |
| [HTTPie](http://httpie.org) 	| Command line tool |
| [Postman REST Client](http://www.getpostman.com/) 														| App for Google Chrome and OS X |
| [DHC REST Client](http://restlet.com/products/dhc/)           | Google Chrome extension |
| [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) 	  | Google Chrome web browser |

Tools that can help build GDC API calls:

| Tool        | Description     |
| ------------- |-------------|
| [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)| Validate JSON strings |
| [Percent-(URL)-encoding tool](http://text-rescue.com/string-escape/percent-url-encoding-tool.html)| Tool for percent-encoding strings |
| [JSON escape tool](http://text-rescue.com/string-escape/json-escape-tool.html)| Tool for escaping strings using JSON string rules |


## API Endpoints

Communicating with the GDC API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each GDC API endpoint represents specific API functionality, as summarized in the following table:

| Endpoint | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | Status | Get the API status and version information |
| projects | Search & Retrieval | Search all data generated by a project |
| cases | Search & Retrieval | Find all files related to a specific case, or sample donor. |
| files | Search & Retrieval | Find all files with specific characteristics such as file_name, md5sum, data_format and others. |
| annotations | Search & Retrieval | Search annotations added to data after curation |
| data | Download | Used to download GDC data |
| manifest | Download | Generates manifests for use with GDC Data Transfer Tool |
| slicing | BAM Slicing | Allows remote slicing of BAM format objects |
| submission | Submission | Returns the available resources at the top level above programs i.e., registered programs |

The HTTP URL that corresponds to the latest version of a GDC API endpoint is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<endpoint>`, where `<endpoint>` is the name of the endpoint.

The HTTP URL of an endpoint corresponding to a specific major version of the GDC API is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/<endpoint>`, where `<endpoint>` is the name of the endpoint and `<version>` is the GDC API version.

For example, the address of the latest version of the `status` endpoint is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/status`, whereas the address of the `status` endpoint corresponding to version 0 of GDC API is `https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/v0/status`.

### GDC Legacy Archive

To interact with data in the GDC Legacy Archive, add `legacy` to the endpoint URL:

	https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/<version>/legacy/<endpoint>


## Entity UUIDs

All objects (*entities*) in the GDC are assigned a unique identifier in the form of a [version 4 universally unique identifier (UUID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). The UUID uniquely identifies the entity in the GDC, and is stored in the entity's `id` property.

UUIDs are frequently used in GDC API requests and responses to identify specific entities like files, cases, and samples.

See [GDC Data Model](../../Data/Data_Model/GDC_Data_Model.md) for details.

## Sample Request

The following is an example of a request to the `files` endpoint, which retrieves information about a BAM file stored in the GDC.

``` shell
curl https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files/d853e541-f16a-4345-9f00-88e03c2dc0bc?pretty=true
```
``` python
import requests
import json

file_endpt = 'https://gdc-api.nci.nih.gov/files/'
file_uuid = 'd853e541-f16a-4345-9f00-88e03c2dc0bc'
response = requests.get(file_endpt + file_uuid)
print json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)
``` Response
{
  "data": {
    "data_type": "Aligned Reads",
    "updated_datetime": "2016-05-26T17:06:40.003624-05:00",
    "created_datetime": "2016-05-26T17:06:40.003624-05:00",
    "file_name": "0017ba4c33a07ba807b29140b0662cb1_gdc_realn.bam",
    "md5sum": "a08304b120c5df76b6532da0e9a35ced",
    "data_format": "BAM",
    "acl": [
      "phs000178"
    ],
    "access": "controlled",
    "platform": "Illumina",
    "state": "submitted",
    "file_id": "d853e541-f16a-4345-9f00-88e03c2dc0bc",
    "data_category": "Raw Sequencing Data",
    "file_size": 23650901931,
    "submitter_id": "c30188d7-be1a-4b43-9a17-e19ccd71792e",
    "type": "aligned_reads",
    "file_state": "processed",
    "experimental_strategy": "WXS"
  },
  "warnings": {}
}
```

The rest of this guide will provide information on how to construct and execute API requests and interpret API responses.

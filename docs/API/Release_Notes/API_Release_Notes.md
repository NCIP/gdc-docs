* Submission: Entities associated with files uploaded to the GDC object store cannot be deleted until the associated file has been deleted. <!-- API-132 -->
* Re-enable Review, Submit, and Release functions for submission <!--API-73, API-138, API-159-->
* GDC Data Dictionary Changes
  * Added "submittable" property to all entities <!--DAT-215-->
  * Changed Read Group to category biospecimen <!--DAT-216-->

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

  * Fixed bug where boolean properties were not accepted with TSV submission <!--API-168-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING". <!-- PGDC-2530 // https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/524  -->
* Certain very large API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up very large requests into a series of smaller requests. <!-- PGDC-2411 -->


## v1.5.0

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: October 31, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* API responds with an error when the request specifies an unsupported combination of `filters` and `facets`. <!-- API-34 -->
* In TSV submissions, trailing and leading whitespace, including non-ASCII whitespace characters, are stripped from property names and values. <!-- API-63, API-29-->
* For released projects, any updates to previously submitted entities (i.e. `"state": "submitted"`) will be included in the following GDC data release. <!-- API-81 -->
* Performance improvements for manifest generation. <!-- API-58 -->

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Uploading certain unsupported metadata files caused the associated submission transactions to remain stuck in pending state. <!-- API-78 -->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING". <!-- PGDC-2530 // https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/524  -->
* Certain very large API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up very large requests into a series of smaller requests. <!-- PGDC-2411 -->




## v1.4.0

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: September 23, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* Submission transaction log includes additional information to assist in tracking. <!-- API-40 -->
* Submission project state transitions are disabled temporarily while project release features are being improved. <!-- API-56 -->
* GDC data dictionary changes:
    * The `submittable` property was added to all entity types in the GDC data model. It indicates whether the entity type can be submitted by users. <!-- DM-16 -->
    * Category of Read Group entities in the GDC Data Model has changed from `data_bundle` to `biospecimen`.
    * Analyte entities support an expanded set of `analyte_type` values.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* None to report

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* API search & retrieval queries that do not include a `sort` parameter may return results in different order each time they are executed. This is a particular problem for paginated responses (i.e. responses to queries for which the number of results is greater than the `size` parameter). <!-- FEAT-120 -->
    * **Workaround:** Include a `sort` parameter in API search & retrieval queries.
* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING". <!-- PGDC-2530 // https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/524  -->

## v1.3.1

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: September 7, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* Successful `_dry_run` submission transactions can be committed to the GDC data model without having to re-upload metadata. The transactions can also be closed to prevent them from being committed in the future.
* Submission transactions can be submitted in asynchronous mode. In this mode, the GDC API will issue an immediate acknowledgement of the transaction, along with the `transaction_id`. The status of the transaction can be verified by the user at a later time by specifying the `transaction_id`. Users submitting large transactions may find this mode helpful.
* New submission transaction properties can be queried with GraphQL
* GDC Data Dictionary changes:
    * Clinical Supplement entities can have `data_format` set to OMF.
    * Biospecimen Supplement entities can have `data_format` set to SSF or PPS.
    * Read group `instrument_model` can be set to "Illumina HiSeq 4000".
    * Category of Slide entities in the GDC Data Model has changed from `data_bundle` to `biospecimen`.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Incorrect BMI calculation in the import of BCR XML files.

* UUIDs in clinical XML files are no longer treated in a case-sensitive way by the `submission` endpoint. <!-- API-14 -->
* Improved performance of `submission` endpoint for transactions that include many cases. <!-- https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/495 -->
* Speed improvements for the `submission` endpoint.

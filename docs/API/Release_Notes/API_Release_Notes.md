# API Release Notes



## v1.3.0

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: August 29, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* Successful `_dry_run` submission transactions can be committed to the GDC data model without having to re-upload metadata. The transactions can also be closed to prevent them from being committed in the future.
* Submission transactions can be submitted in asynchronous mode. In this mode, the GDC API will issue an immediate acknowledgement of the transaction, along with the `transaction_id`. The status of the transaction can be verified by the user at a later time by specifying the `transaction_id`. Users submitting large transactions may find this mode helpful.
* New submission transaction properties can be queried with GraphQL
* GDC Data Dictionary changes:
    * Clinical Supplement entities can have `data_format` set to OMF.
    * Biospecimen Supplement entities can have `data_format` set to SSF or PPS.
    * Read group `instrument_model` can be set to "Illumina HiSeq 4000".
    * Category of Slide entities in the GDC Data Model has changed from `data_bundle` to `biospecimen`.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Incorrect BMI calculation in the import of BCR XML files.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* API search & retrieval queries that do not include a `sort` parameter may return results in different order each time they are executed. This is a particular problem for paginated responses (i.e. responses to queries for which the number of results is greater than the `size` parameter). <!-- FEAT-120 -->
    * **Workaround:** Include a `sort` parameter in API search & retrieval queries.
* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING". <!-- PGDC-2530 // https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/524  -->
* Certain very large API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up very large requests into a series of smaller requests. <!-- PGDC-2411 -->




## v1.2.0

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: August 9, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* Tarballs generated by the `data` endpoint in response to multi-file data download requests now include a folder structure that puts each file in a folder whose name is the file's UUID. <!-- PGDC-2581 -->
* UUIDs in clinical XML files are no longer treated in a case-sensitive way by the `submission` endpoint. <!-- API-14 -->
* Improved performance of `submission` endpoint for transactions that include many cases. <!-- https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/495 -->
* Speed improvements for the `submission` endpoint.
* BCR XML is no longer validated against its XSD at submission.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Fixed handling of `POST` requests to address problems with cart functionality in older versions of Firefox <!-- PGDC-2555 -->
* Files of category `related_files` can now be downloaded from the `data` endpoint. <!-- PGDC-2542 -->
* Allowed submission by projects in certain dbGaP registration states that were previously blocked. <!--API-3 -->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* API search & retrieval queries that do not include a `sort` parameter may return results in different order each time they are executed. This is a particular problem for paginated responses (i.e. responses to queries for which the number of results is greater than the `size` parameter). <!-- FEAT-120 -->
    * **Workaround:** Include a `sort` parameter in API search & retrieval queries.
* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING". <!-- PGDC-2530 // https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdcapi/pull/524  -->
* Certain very large API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up very large requests into a series of smaller requests. <!-- PGDC-2411 -->




## v1.1.0

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: May 25, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* BAM index files (.bai) are now automatically downloaded with parent BAM.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* None to report

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Sorting by file `submitter_id` no longer causes an internal server error
* BAM index files are now included with harmonized BAM files
* Certain very long API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up into a series of smaller requests.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Fields are not counted as missing if parent field is also missing.  This may occur with queries of nested fields in the Data Portal Advanced Search or an API query using a filter.  This behavior could impact results reported using search parameters of "IS MISSING" or "NOT MISSING".

## v1.0.1

* __GDC Product__: Application Programming Interface (API)
* __Release Date__: May 16, 2016

### New Features and Changes

* HTTP interface that uses JSON as the primary data exchange format
* Programmatic access to functionality provided by GDC Data and Submission portals, via `projects`, `cases`, `files`, `annotations`, `data`, `slicing`, `status`, and `submission` endpoints
* Programmatic access to GDC Legacy Archive via `legacy` endpoint
* Token-based authentication for secure access to controlled data and to submission functionality
* RESTful search that supports simple and complex queries via `filters`, `fields`, and `facets` parameters, and `project`, `files`, `cases`, and `annotations` endpoints.
* Search results can be sorted using `sort` parameter, paginated using `size` and `from` parameters, and output in JSON, TSV, and XML using `format` and `pretty` parameters.
* `_mapping` endpoint enables user discovery of fields available for data search and retrieval operations
* Support for downloading of individual files and of archives containing multiple files
* Generation of download and upload manifests for use with the GDC Data Transfer Tool
* BAM slicing functionality for downloading part(s) of a BAM file specified using chromosomal coordinates or HGNC gene names
* Transactional submission system that links individual data elements according to a graph-based GDC Data Model
* Two data entity identifiers: UUIDs, which are consistent across GDC, and Submitter IDs, for compatibility with submitters' tracking systems

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* None to report


### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Use of non-ascii characters in token passed to Data Transfer Tool will produce incorrect error message "Internal server error: Auth service temporarily unavailable".
* Use of a decimal in an integer search field produces unexpected error.
* Certain very large API requests will time out.  It is recommended to break up very large requests into a series of smaller requests.

* In Browse > Case > Details, experimental data are not listed in "Related Entities" section<!--PGDC-850-->.
* When uploading multiple files at once, validation will fail if a child entity is listed before its parent. A workaround is to ensure parent entities are listed before their children in the Upload wizard<!--PGDC-861-->.
* Submission status column is inconsistent between Submitted Files and Read Group. Submission Status says "Validated" when it should say "Submitted" when users submit data to the GDC<!--PGDC-959-->.
* In the upload report, the number of affected cases is incorrect (show 0) when entities are created<!--PGDC-838-->.
* In Dashboard > Release, Download of submitted data returns data from the project workspace but not from snapshot (submitted files)<!--PGDC-774-->.
* In Browse > Read Groups, the data completeness property is incorrect when multiple files are in the bundle<!--PGDC-916-->.
* In Browse > Diagnosis/Treatment > Details, the hierarchy section is missing elements<!--PGDC-1023-->.
* Data Validation Report: The rows in the report are sometimes duplicated and #Files in error are not showing up in the report. The user should go to Project > Browse > Submitted Files to see the files in error and the error type<!--PGDC-1025 and PGDC-997-->.
* The Scientific Pre-alignment QC Report is not available.
* The Submission Portal is not meant to support XML file submission, users have to submit files through the GDC API.

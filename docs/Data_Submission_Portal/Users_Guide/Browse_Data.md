# Browse Data

## Overview

The _"Browse"_ menu provides access to all of a project's content. Most content is driven by the GDC Data Dictionary and the interface is dynamically generated to accomodate the content.

Please refer to the [GDC Data Dictionary Viewer](../../Data_Dictionary/viewer.md) for more details about dictionary-generated fields, columns and filters.

All static components are detailed in this User Guide.

## Main Interface Elements

### Upload

An __Upload__ button is available at the top-left section of the left panel. Depending on the project state, this will allow data to be [uploaded](Upload_Data.md) to the GDC. 

__Note__: This button is disabled if the project is in "REVIEW" state.

### Filters

A wide set of filters are available for the user to select the type of entity to be displayed. These filters are dynamically created based on the [GDC Data Dictionary](../../Data_Dictionary/index.md).

Current filters are:

|Filter|Description|
| --- | --- |
| All Cases | Display all cases associated with the project. |
| Cases Missing Clinical Data | Display only cases with no clinical data. |
| Cases Missing Samples Data | Display only cases with no biospecimen data associated with the case. |
| Clinical Entities | Display all clinical data uploaded to the project workspace. |
| Experiment Data | Display all experiment data uploaded to the project workspace. Currently it will show the read groups, slides and associated submitted files metadata. |
| Transactions | Display all transactions associated with the project. More details about transactions can be found in the [Transactions](Transactions.md) section of the documentation. |
| Annotations | List all annotations associated with the project. An annotation provides an explanatory comment that has been associated with data in the project. |


### List View

The list view is a paginated list of all entities corresponding to the selected filter. 

On the top-left section of the screen, the user can download data about all entities associated with the selected filter.

* For the case filter, it will download all clinical data.
* For the filter of the other entities, it will download the corresponding metadata (e.g., for the demographic filter, it will download all demographic data).

* Summary: IDs and system properties associated with the entity.

This section is available only at the case level.

This table contains the following columns:

* Category: Category of the Entity (Clinical, Biospecimen, Experiment Data).
* Type: Type of entity (based on Data Dictionary).
* Count: Number of occurences of an entity of this type associated with the case. Clicking on the count will open a list page listing those entities.

#### Focus on Hierachy

The hierarchy section is available at any entity level (e.g., Clinical, Biospecimen, etc.), except for Case.

The hierarchy shows:

* The Case associated with the entity.
* The __direct__ parents of the entity.
* The __direct__ children of the entity.

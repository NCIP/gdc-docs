# Getting Started

## Overview

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Submission Portal User's Guide is the companion documentation for the [GDC Data Submission Portal](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-submission-portal) and provides detailed information and instructions for its use.

The GDC Data Submission Portal is a platform that allows researchers to submit and release data into the GDC. The key features of the GDC Data Submission Portal are:

* __Upload and Validate Data__: Upload project data to the GDC project workspace. The GDC will validate the data against the [GDC Data Dictionary](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data_Dictionary/).
* __Review and Submit Data__: Review project data which will lock the project to ensure that additional data cannot be uploaded while in review. Once the review is complete, the data can be submitted to the GDC for processing through the [GDC Harmonization Process](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization).
* __Release Data__: Release data to the research community for access through [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).
* __Download Data__: Download data that has been uploaded into the project workspace for review or update. Re-upload data before the data is released for access through [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).
* __Browse Data__: Browse data that has been uploaded to the project workspace to ensure that the project is ready for processing.
* __Status and Alerts__: Obtain visual cues to easily identify incomplete submissions.
* __Reports__: Access and download submission-related reports to gain better insight into the status of submitted data.

## Key Features

### Upload and Validate Data
In order to submit data to the GDC, the submitter will prepare the data and upload it to the project workspace.

The main categories of data that can be uploaded include:

* Clinical Data: Elements such as gender, age, diagnosis, etc. as defined in the GDC Data Dictionary.
* Biospecimen Data: Entities such as samples, aliquots, etc. as defined in the GDC Data Dictionary.
* Experiment Data: Sequencing data such as BAM and FASTQ files, pathology slide images, and other experiment data collected by the study.

By using the [GDC Data Dictionary Viewer](../../Data_Dictionary/viewer.md), the user can identify the minimum field requirements for each of the three categories listed above.

### Review and Submit Data

Once data is uploaded to the project workspace, the submitter or project owner should review it to ensure that the data is ready for processing through the [GDC Harmonization Process](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization). The review will lock the project to ensure that additional data cannot be uploaded while in review. During this period, the submitter or project owner can browse or download the data in the Data Submission Portal.

If the project is ready for processing, the submitter or project owner can submit the data to the GDC. If the project is not ready for processing, the submitter or project owner can re-open it. This will allow the submitter to upload additional data to the project workspace.

### Release Data

To ensure that the GDC always releases high-quality data, harmonized data is not automatically released. The Submitter or Project Owner will be able to review harmonized data and decide whether to release the data to the public. Confirmation of release will initiate data indexing and will release the data to the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/projects/t) and other [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).

### Redaction

Data uploaded to the GDC can be deleted and updated by the submitter before it is submitted for processing and harmonization. After harmonized data is released, it can only be redacted by GDC Administrators under certain conditions. To request redaction of released data, please contact GDC User Services.

### Browse and Download Data

GDC Data Submission Portal allows authorized submitters to browse and retrieve data submitted to their project.

### Status and Alerts

The GDC Data Submission Portal dashboard and navigation panel displays a summary of submitted data and missing data elements, such as cases missing clinical data or biospecimen data.

### Transactions

Submitters can access a list of all actions performed in a project by clicking on transactions in the Browse menu. This will display a list of all past transactions for the selected project. By clicking on a transaction, users can access details of this transaction.

Transactions are also displayed on the dashboard highlighting the most recent transactions.

### Reports

The GDC Data Submission Portal provides a broad range of submission-oriented reports. Reports are detailed in the [Reports](Reports.md) section.

## Release Notes

The [Release Notes](../../Data_Submission_Portal/Release_Notes/Data_Submission_Portal_Release_Notes.md) section of this User's Guide contains details about new features, bug fixes and known issues.

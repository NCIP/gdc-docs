# Homepage

## Overview

After [authentication](Authentication.md), users are redirected to a homepage if the user has access to multiple projects. The homepage acts as the entry point for GDC data submission and provides submitters with access to a list of authorized projects, reports, and transactions.

Content on the homepage varies based on the user profile (e.g. submitter, program office).

If the submitter has access to only one project, then the dashboard for the project will automatically be displayed instead of the homepage.

## Reports

The reports section in the homepage provides access to project reports on data submission, based on user authorization. More details about the reports are available in the [Reports](Reports.md) section.

## Projects

The projects section in the homepage lists the projects that the user has access to. For users having access to a large number of projects, this table can be filtered down and sorted by clicking on the column headers.

Selecting a project ID will redirect the user to the [Project's dashboard](Dashboard.md).

## Latest Transactions

The latest transactions section in the homepage lists the most recent [transactions](Transactions.md) associated with the projects that the user has access to.

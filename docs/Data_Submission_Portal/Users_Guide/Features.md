The above image illustrates the GDC Data Submission Portal sitemap. Submitters access the homepage after logging into the portal and perform data submission through the dashboard.

## Homepage

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Homepage](images/GDC_Submission_Homepage.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Homepage.png "Click to see the full image.")

Once the submitter logs into the GDC Data Submission Portal, the homepage is displayed. The homepage provides access to project reports on previously submitted data, provides a list of projects that the submitter is authorized to submit data into, and lists the latest transactions performed on these projects. Links to documentation are also provided. 

To submit data into a project, the submitter selects the project from the list of projects and a dashboard for the project is displayed. 

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides quick access to all the actions a submitter or project owner can perform:

* __Charts__: Provides information on the content of project data (e.g. 28 registered cases in this project have clinical data).
* __Actions__: Provides the list of actions that the user can perform as part of the submission process such as upload and validate the data, review and submit the data, and release the data. This list varies depending on the user's privileges.
* __Latest Transactions__: Displays the latest data submission transactions that have occurred on the project.
* __Reports__: Provides links to reports on the project (e.g. Case Overview Report, Data Validation Report).
* __Browse__: Provides a link to browse submitted data as described in the Browse section below.

The table view supports pagination and column sorting. When applicable, alerts are displayed in the rightmost column to notify the submitter that additional attention is required, such as missing clinical or biospecimen data.

### Details Panel

The third panel, on the right-hand side of the page, provides more details about a selected entity. The exact content in this panel depends on the type of entity (e.g., case, sample, transaction) selected in the navigation panel.

[![Browse Detail Panel](images/GDC_Submission_Details_Panel.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Details_Panel.png "Click to see the full image.")

The transactions section in the panel lists all past transactions associated with an entity, clicking on a transaction will redirect the user to this particular transaction.

## Quick Search

The quick search feature available at the top of the dashboard and browse menu will provide the ability to search for an entity and display the results in the browse menu. To search for an entity, the submitter can begin entering the entity ID in the search box and the autocomplete feature will provide a list of suggested entities for selection.

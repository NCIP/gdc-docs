## Getting Started

### Getting Started

#### Overview

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Submission Portal User's Guide is the companion documentation for the [GDC Data Submission Portal](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-submission-portal) and provides detailed information and instructions for its use.

The GDC Data Submission Portal is a platform that allows researchers to submit and release data into the GDC. The key features of the GDC Data Submission Portal are:

* __Upload and Validate Data__: Upload project data to the GDC project workspace. The GDC will validate the data against the [GDC Data Dictionary](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data_Dictionary/).
* __Review and Submit Data__: Review project data which will lock the project to ensure that additional data cannot be uploaded while in review. Once the review is complete, the data can be submitted to the GDC for processing through the [GDC Harmonization Process](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization).
* __Release Data__: Release data to the research community for access through [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).
* __Download Data__: Download data that has been uploaded into the project workspace for review or update. Re-upload data before the data is released for access through [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).
* __Browse Data__: Browse data that has been uploaded to the project workspace to ensure that the project is ready for processing.
* __Status and Alerts__: Obtain visual cues to easily identify incomplete submissions.
* __Reports__: Access and download submission-related reports to gain better insight into the status of submitted data.

#### Submission Workflow

The Submission Workflow is described in detail in the Data Submission Workflow section.

#### Key Features

##### Upload and Validate Data
In order to submit data to the GDC, the submitter will prepare the data and upload it to the project workspace.

The main categories of data that can be uploaded include:

* Clinical Data: Elements such as gender, age, diagnosis, etc. as defined in the GDC Data Dictionary.
* Biospecimen Data: Entities such as samples, aliquots, etc. as defined in the GDC Data Dictionary.
* Experiment Data: At least one type of experiment data, such as a read group, as defined in the GDC Data Dictionary.

By using the GDC Data Dictionary Viewer, the user can identify the minimum field requirements for each of the three categories listed above.

In general, submitters have six months to upload data to the project workspace before it should be submitted to the GDC.

##### Review and Submit Data

Once data is uploaded to the project workspace, the submitter or project owner should review it to ensure that the data is ready for processing through the [GDC Harmonization Process](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization). The review will lock the project to ensure that additional data cannot be uploaded while in review. During this period, the submitter or project owner can browse or download the data in the Data Submission Portal.

If the project is ready for processing, the submitter or project owner can submit the data to the GDC. If the project is not ready for processing, the submitter or project owner can re-open it. This will allow the submitter to upload additional data to the project workspace.

In general, submitters are requested to submit their data to the GDC within six months from the first upload to the project workspace.

##### Release Data

To ensure that the GDC always releases high-quality data, harmonized data is not automatically released. The Submitter or Project Owner will be able to review harmonized data and decide whether to release the data to the GDC. The confirmation of the release will initiate data indexing and will release the data to the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/projects/t) and other [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).

In general, submitters are requested to release files within six months from submission to the GDC. This guideline is in place in support of the GDC's aim to make data available to the community according to the [NCI Genomic Data Sharing Policy](http://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/grants-management/nci-policies/genomic-data).

Released cases and/or files can be redacted from the GDC. Redaction is performed by GDC administrators, at the case level through synchronization with dbGaP, and at file level through a submitter's request usually after a data quality issue is identified. The GDC Data Submission Portal itself currently does not support redaction through the web user interface.

##### Browse and Download Data

In addition to submitting and releasing files, the GDC Data Submission Portal can also display submitted files and entities through multiple pages and tables.

Along with listing entities, the GDC Data Submission Portal also offers users the ability to download files submitted initially or the latest version of a specific entity (e.g. the clinical data for a case).

##### Status and Alerts

The GDC Data Submission Portal dashboard and navigation panel displays the number of missing elements to be attached to an entity, such as cases missing clinical data or biospecimen data.

##### Transactions

The user can access a list of all actions performed in a project by clicking on transactions in the Browse menu (e.g., upload data, review project, etc.). This will display a list of all past transactions for the selected project. By clicking on a transaction, users can access details of this transaction as well as download the original uploaded files.

Transactions are also displayed on the dashboard highlighting the most recent transactions.

##### Reports

The GDC Data Submission Portal provides a broad range of submission oriented reports. Reports are detailed in the Reports section.

#### Access

The GDC Data Submission Portal is accessible using a web browser such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Firefox at the following URL: [https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/submission/](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/submission/).
Upon navigating to the site, the GDC Data Submission Portal login page or dashboard is displayed.

#### Release Notes

The GDC Data Submission Portal is regularly being updated with new features. The Release Notes section contains details about new features, bug fixes and known issues.

## Submission Workflow

### Submission Workflow

#### Overview

The workflow diagram below represents the data submission process that is implemented by the GDC Data Submission Portal. In this process, the submitter logs into the GDC Data Submission Portal, uploads data into the project workspace, and validates the data. Once the data is ready for processing, the submitter reviews the data and submits the data to the GDC. The GDC processes the data through the [GDC Harmonization Process](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization). Once harmonization has been completed, the submitter reviews the harmonized data and releases the data to the GDC for access through the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/) and other [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Workflow](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Upload and Validate Data
The submitter will upload clinical and biospecimen data to the project workspace using GDC templates that are available and described in the [GDC Data Dictionary](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data_Dictionary/). The GDC will validate the uploaded data against the GDC Data Dictionary. The submitter will upload experiment metadata to the workspace which will register experiment data for submission through the [Data Transfer Tool](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool), a high performance client-based tool for uploading data. Once the submitter uploads the experiment metadata, the GDC Data Submission Portal will generate a manifest file that identifies the experiment data that will be uploaded. The submitter will use the manifest file to upload the experiment data through the Data Transfer Tool.

At this point, the data is not yet submitted to the GDC.

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Workflow Upload](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Upload.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Upload.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Review and Submit Data
When data in the project workspace is ready for processing, the submitter or project owner must submit the data to the GDC in order for processing to occur through the [GDC Data Harmonization Pipeline](https://gdc-dev.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization). Submitting data to the GDC will initiate the GDC Data Harmonization Pipeline.

During this process, there are two primary actions that should be performed:

* Review the Project: When a submitter reviews the project, the project is locked to prevent other users who are authorized to submit data to the project from uploading new data. During this process, the submitter should verify that the data is ready for processing. If during the review process, the submitter thinks the data is not ready for processing, the submitter can re-open the project. This would allow the submitter or authorized user to upload additional data to the project workspace.
* Submit the Data: After reviewing the project data, the user can submit the project to the GDC. This will trigger the harmonization process.

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Workflow Submit](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Submit.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Submit.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Release Data
When the GDC harmonized data is ready and the project data is complete, the submitter or project owner will release the project. This will release harmonized data to the GDC for access through the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/) and other [GDC Data Access Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/data-access-processes-and-tools).

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Workflow Release](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Release.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Release.png "Click to see the full image.")

#### Project Life Cyle

The life cycle of a project in the GDC describes the workflow of a project throughout the data submission process. The project life cycle starts with the upload and validation of data into the project and ends with the release of the harmonized data to the GDC Data Portal and other GDC data access tools. Throughout the life cycle, the project transitions through various states in which the project is open for uploading data, in review, and released. This life cycle is continuous as new project data becomes available.

To summarize the project life cycle and transition to the various states of the project, the following operations can be performed by the submitter:

* The submitter can upload and validate data if the project __is not in__ REVIEW.
* The submitter can review the project if it __is__ OPEN. The GDC will prevent users from uploading any new data during the review period.
* The submitter can submit data to the GDC for processing if the project __is in__ REVIEW.
* The submitter can release the project once the data has been submitted and processed. The GDC will release the harmonized data to the GDC Data Portal and other GDC Data Access Tools.

Note: "Submit to the GDC" and "Release" actions can be performed only if the user has release privileges.

##### Project State
The diagram below demonstrates the transition of a project through the various states. In the initial state, the project is OPEN for data upload and validation. Once the data is ready for review, the project state transitions to REVIEW. During the REVIEW state, the project is locked so that additional data cannot be uploaded. Once review has been completed and the submitter submits the data for GDC processing, the project state transitions to SUBMITTED. If during the review period, additional data changes are needed, the project can be re-opened and the state transitions back to OPEN. Once the data has been processed, the submitter can release the data and the project state transitions to RELEASE. Once the data is released to the GDC for access through GDC data access tools, the project state transitions back to OPEN to allow for new data to be submitted to the project.

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Project State](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Project_State.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Release_State.png "Click to see the full image.")

##### Project Release State
Once a submitter selects to release the data, the project state transitions to RELEASE. If the submitter does not select to release the data within six months of data harmonization, the data is automatically released per the [NCI Genomic Data Sharing Policy](http://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/grants-management/nci-policies/genomic-data).

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Project Release State](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Project_Release_State.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Project_Release_State.png "Click to see the full image.")

#### File Status Life Cycle

The life cycle of a file in the GDC describes the workflow of an actual file throughout the data submission process. The life cycle starts when a submitter uploads file metadata to the Submission Portal. The act of uploading the file metadata, registers the file in the GDC. The submitter can then use the [GDC Data Transfer Tool](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool), a high performance client-based tool, to upload the actual file. Throughout the life cycle, the file status transitions through various states from when the file is initialy registered through file processing.

To summarize the file status life cycle and transition to the various states of the file, the following operations can be performed by the submitter:

* The submitter uploads the file metadata to the Submission Portal which sets the file status to REGISTERED.
* The submitter then uploads the actual file through the GDC Data Transfer Tool which sets the file status to UPLOADING and UPLOADED when the file upload has completed. The Submission Portal displays "__# Files Uploaded__" in the last chart on the dashboard which represents the number of files that the user uploaded through the GDC Data Transfer Tool.
* The GDC validates the uploaded data which sets the file status to VALIDATING and VALIDATED once complete.
* The submitter submits the validated file to the GDC which sets the file status to SUBMITTED.
* The GDC processes the file which sets the file status to PROCESSING and PROCESSED once complete.
* An error occurs during file validation or processing. The GDC sets the file status to ERROR.

## Authentication

### Authentication

#### Overview

Accessing the GDC Data Submission Portal requires eRA Commons credentials with appropriate dbGap authorization. See [Obtaining Access to Submit Data]( https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/obtaining-access-submit-data) for more details.

Permissions are attached to each user account. Access can be granted to one or more projects. Those permissions will apply throughout the GDC Data Portal and GDC Data Submission Portal and will define how data is being displayed.

#### Authentication via eRA Commons

By Clicking on "Login", users will be invited to authentication through eRA Commons. If successful, the user will be redirected to the GDC Data Portal or GDC Data Submission Portal.

[![GDC Data Submission Portal splash page](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Commons/images/GDC_Submission_Login_eRA_Commons.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Login_eRA_Commons.png "Click to see the full image.")

#### GDC Authentication Token

A Token is required to upload data to GDC, as well as to download controlled-access files, using the GDC Data Transfer Tool or the GDC Application Programming Interface (API).

The GDC Data Transfer Tool is optimized for large transfers with multi-part upload and integrity checking, making it the most efficient tool for molecular data submission.

Tokens are strings of characters provided with every GDC call requiring authentication. A file containing a token can be obtained through GDC Data Submission Portal once your NIH eRA Commons account has been established. Your GDC account will be automatically established upon first login and you will see a drop down menu next to your user name.

##### Obtain a Token From GDC Data Portal

After successful authentication, users can obtain their Token be clicking on their username on the top right corner of the screen.

#### Reports

The reports section in the dashboard provides access to project reports on data submission, based on user authorization. More details about the reports are available in the Reports section.

## Upload and Validate Data

### Upload and Validate Data

#### Overview

The GDC Data Submission process is detailed on the [GDC Website]( https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/data-submission-processes-and-tools).

This chapter will focus on the upload and validation of data to the project workspace.

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Workflow Upload](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Upload.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Upload.png "Click to see the full image.")


#### Introduction to Files

##### File Format

The GDC Data Submission Portal supports the following file formats for submission:

* JSON
* TSV

During the upload and validation process, files are converted by the GDC API into entities and inserted into the database, maintaining a file-agnostic back-end.

The GDC Data Submission Portal offers the ability to download files in different formats. To do so the system converts database entities back to the requested file format.

##### File Type
The GDC Data Submission Portal supports the following types of files for upload to the GDC:

* __Clinical__: A case’s clinical data.
* __Biospecimen__: Metadata describing a tissue specimen collected from a case and other material derived from samples for analysis.
* __Experiment Data__: GDC's unit of submission (see below).
* __Annotations__: Observations associated with any entity, which can be useful for interpreting the data.

More details about the submission process, data files and file formats can be found on the GDC website at [Data Submission Processes and Tools](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/data-submission-processes-and-tools) and [Data Types and File Formats](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-types-and-file-formats).

###### Focus on Experiment Data

The GDC has developed a submission unit called a “data bundle”, which is a set of files with associated metadata.

Data bundle types are defined by what files are expected and what introspection is done for validation or linking to other GDC entities. Each data bundle will be validated via a bundle type and project specific schema, including a JSON data dictionary, relationship check and molecular data quality check.

The experiment data supported by the GDC is described in the GDC Data Dictionary.

The table below is an example of files used to upload a read group to the GDC. The next section will describe how to perform these actions.

+-----+----------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| #   | File name            | Description   | GDC Tool                                                         |
+=====+======================+===============+==================================================================+
| 1a  | read_group.tsv       | Read Group    | Upload this file to the Submission Portal. It describes the      |

#### Step 1: Prepare Files

The GDC Data Dictionary describes the types of entities that can be uploaded to the GDC.

The user can go to the GDC Data Dictionary to __download the template files__ to be used for the upload. The templates can be populated with data by the user and should result in a valid file (if validation rules detailed in the Data Dictionary are met).

A template file describes an entity with the following information:

* __Type__: identification of the entity.
* __Unique Keys__: Project ID and Submitter ID of the entity.
* __Links__: Submitter ID of the links to other entities.
* __Properties__: user properties of the entity.

##### Focus on Links

In order to identify the relationship between two entities, the user should include in the file of the child entity a reference to the parent submitter ID (called link).

For example, a Demographic entity describes a Case entity. The user should define __cases.submitter_id__ in the Demographic file.


##### Examples of files

###### Demographic


Example below of a __demographic file__ that can be uploaded in TSV format.

The structure of the file is the following:

* Type = demographic
* Unique Keys = project\_id, submitter_id
* Links = cases.submitter_id
* Properties = ethnicity, gender, etc.

```tsv
type	project_id	submitter_id	cases.submitter_id	ethnicity	gender	race	year_of_birth	year_of_death
demographic	TCGA-DEV3	TCGA-DEV-3-CASE-000-D1	TCGA-DEV-3-CASE-000	hispanic or latino	male	white	1950	0
demographic	TCGA-DEV3	TCGA-DEV-3-CASE-001-D1	TCGA-DEV-3-CASE-001	not reported	female	white	1956	0
```


###### Read Group and Submitted File

Example of a __Read Group__ upload, which needs 2 TSV files to describe metadata.

File 1: read_group.tsv

```tsv
type	project_id	submitter_id	aliquots.submitter_id	experiment_name	is_paired_end	library_name	library_strategy	platform	read_group_name	read_length	sequencing_center	RIN	adapter_name	adapter_sequence	base_caller_name	base_caller_version	fastq_name	flow_cell_barcode	includes_spike_ins	instrument_model	library_preparation_kit_catalog_number	library_preparation_kit_name	library_preparation_kit_vendor	library_preparation_kit_version	library_selection	library_strand	sequencing_date	size_selection_range	spike_ins_concentration	spike_ins_fasta	target_capture_kit_catalog_number	target_capture_kit_name	target_capture_kit_target_region	target_capture_kit_vendor	target_capture_kit_version	to_trim_adapter_sequence
read_group	TCGA-DEV3	read_group_ID1	TCGA-DEV-3-CASE-000-S1-AL1	Text for Experiment	TRUE	lib_1	WXS	Illumina	35	101	test								FALSE																	FALSE
```

File 2: submitted_file.tsv

```tsv
type	project_id	submitter_id	read_groups.submitter_id#1	slides.submitter_id	file_name	file_size	md5sum	file_format	state_comment
submitted_file	TCGA-DEV3	fileID1_CASE-000-AL1	read_group_ID1		fileID88_CASE-000.fastq	61004	311253B0CA93B396A41C0A88F01557AE	fastq
```


Once the user has prepared their files (in TSV or JSON format), they can move on to the next step, uploading their data through the Upload Data Wizard.

**Note:** Before you can upload clinical, biospecimen or experiment data, the cases must be registered in the GDC. If the cases are not displayed in your project dashboard, please download the Case template from the GDC Data Dictionary, complete it with the Cases Submitter IDs and upload the Cases through the Upload Data Wizard.

#### Step 2: Upload Data Wizard


The GDC Data Submission Portal is equipped with a wizard window to guide you through the upload and validation of data. There are three stages:

* __Upload Files__: Upload a file into the user's browser, at this point nothing is submitted to the project workspace.
* __Validate Files__: Send a file to the GDC backend to validate its content (see below).
* __Confirm Upload__: Submit a validated file to the project workspace and produce a report.

The _'File Validation'_ stage acts as a safeguard against submitting incorrect files to the GDC Data Submission Portal. During the validation stage, the GDC API will validate the content of submitted files against the project's data dictionary to detect potential errors. Invalid files will be flagged and upload to the GDC will be denied until corrections are made by the user. A validation error report provided by the system can be used to isolate and correct errors for resubmission.

##### Upload Files

From the project dashboard, clicking on _'UPLOAD'_ will open the submission wizard.

[![GDC Submission Wizard Upload Files](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Upload.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Upload.png "Click to see the full image.")

Files can be added either by clicking on _'CHOOSE FILE(S)'_ or by using drag and drop.

##### Validate Files

As soon as the first file is added, the wizard will move to the _'VALIDATE'_ section and the user can continue to add files.

[![GDC Submission Wizard Validate Files](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Validate.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Validate.png "Click to see the full image.")

Once all files have been added, clicking on _'VALIDATE'_ will check if the files are valid for submission.

[![Confirm Submission](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Confirm.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Confirm.png "Click to see the full image.")

If the upload contains invalid files, the user will not be able to submit the data and those files will need to be either corrected and re-uploaded or removed from the submission.

[![Invalid Files in a Submission](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Invalid_Files.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Wizard_Invalid_Files.png "Click to see the full image.")

Files can be removed from the submission by clicking on the _'garbage'_ icon related to the file.

Click on _'View Report'_ to see the error report which provides details about why files failed validation. This report is detailed in the Data Submission Reports section of the documentation.



##### Confirm Upload

Once all files are valid for upload, clicking on _'Confirm Upload'_ will upload your files to the GDC project workspace.

**Note:** Uploaded files are not released immediately. The user must submit the data to the GDC and release the project to make data available on the GDC Data Portal.

[![Successful Submission](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_wizard_successful_submission.png)](images/GDC_Submission_wizard_successful_submission.png "Click to see the full image.")

You can then click on _'CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE TRANSACTION'_ to be redirected to the transaction list page.

#### Step 3: GDC Data Transfer Tool


**Step 3 is applicable to Experiment Data only.**

The GDC Data Transfer Tool is used to upload the actual file.

Once the user has uploaded the metadata through the Upload Data Wizard (e.g., read_group and submitted file metadata), they will be able to download the manifest from the transaction report.

**Note:** You can also download the manifest from the Browse menu.

[![Transaction Manifest](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Transactions_Get_Manifest.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Transactions_Get_Manifest.png "Click to see the full image.")

Users can use this manifest to upload their actual files to the GDC Data Transfer Tool. Please refer to the [GDC Data Transfer Tool's User Guide] (../Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/Getting_Started.md) for more information.

#### Download previously submitted files

The transaction page, accessible through the Browse menu, lists all previous transactions in the project. The user can download submitted files in the details section of the screen by selecting a particular transaction.

## Submit and Release Data

### Submit and Release

#### Overview

The GDC Data Submission process is detailed on the [GDC Website]( https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/data-submission-processes-and-tools).

This chapter will focus on the following features:

* The review and submission of data to the GDC.
* The Release of data to the GDC Data Portal

#### Review and Submit

Once data is uploaded to the project workspace (see previous section: Upload Data, the submitter or project owner should review it to ensure that data is ready for processing by the GDC ([Harmonization Process](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/submit-data/gdc-data-harmonization)).

The review will lock the project and ensure no user can upload more data. During that period, the submitter or project owner can browse the data in the Submission Portal or download it.

If the project is ready for processing, the submitter or project owner will submit data to the GDC.

If the project is not ready for processing, the submitter or project owner can re-open it. Then the submitter will be able to upload more data to the project workspace.

In general, submitters are requested to submit their data to the GDC within six months from the first upload to the project workspace.

##### Review

To review and submit data to the GDC, the user should have release privileges. The user will be able to view the section below on the dashboard.

The "Review" button is available only if the project is in "OPEN" state.

[![GDC Submission Review Tab](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Review_tab.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Review_tab.png "Click to see the full image.")

Reviewing the project will prevent other users from uploading data to the project. Once the review is complete, the user can submit data to the GDC.

Once the user clicks on "Review", the project state will change to "REVIEW":

[![GDC Submission Review State](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Project_State_Review.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Project_State_Review.png "Click to see the full image.")



##### Submit to the GDC

The "Submit" button is available only if the project is in "REVIEW" state. At this point, the user can decide whether to re-open the project to upload more data or to submit data to the GDC.

Once the user submits data to the GDC, they __cannot upload additional data until the harmonization process is complete__.

[![GDC Submission Submit Tab](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Submit_tab.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Submit_tab.png "Click to see the full image.")

When the user clicks on the action "Submit", the following Submit popup is displayed:

[![GDC Submission Submit Popup](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Submit_Popup.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Submit_Popup.png "Click to see the full image.")


After the user clicks on "Submit Validated Data to the GDC", the project state becomes "Submitted":
[![GDC Submission Project State](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Project_State.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Project_State.png "Click to see the full image.")


#### Release
The project owner should release data when harmonization process is complete and the harmonized data is ready to release.
Releasing the data will make the data available to the GDC Data Portal.

As soon as the project owner releases the project, any harmonized (updated or added to the project) will be released to the [GDC Data Portal](https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/projects/t).

[![GDC Data Submission Portal Workflow Release](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Release.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Portal_Workflow_Release.png "Click to see the full image.")

To release data to the GDC Data Portal, the user should have release privileges. The user will be able to view the following section on the dashboard.

[![GDC Submission Release Tab](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Release_tab.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Release_tab.png "Click to see the full image.")

When the user clicks on the action "Release", the following Release popup is displayed:

[![GDC Submission Release Popup](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Release_Popup.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Release_Popup.png "Click to see the full image.")

After the user clicks on "Release Submitted and Processed Data", the project release state becomes "Released":

[![GDC Submission Project State](/Users/FGerthoffert/GitHub/gdc-docs/site/Data_Submission_Portal/Users_Guide/images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Project_State.png)](images/GDC_Submission_Submit_Release_Project_State.png "Click to see the full image.")


__Note__: Released cases and/or files can be redacted from the GDC. Redaction is performed by GDC administrators, at case level through synchronization with dbGaP, and at file level at the submitter's request usually after a data quality issue is identified. The GDC Data Submission Portal itself currently does not support redaction through the web user interface.

## Browse Data

#### Transactions Details

Clicking on a transaction will open the details panel. Data in this panel is organized into multiple sections including actions, details, types, and documents as described below.

Navigation between the sections can be performed by either scrolling down or by clicking on the section icon displayed on the left side of the details panel.

##### Actions

The Actions section allows a user to perform an action for transactions that provide actions. For example, if a user uploads read groups and file metadata, a corresponding manifest file will be available for download from the transaction. This manifest is used to upload the actual files through the [GDC Data Transfer Tool](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool).

##### Details

The Details section provides details about the transaction itself, such as its project, type, and number of affected cases.

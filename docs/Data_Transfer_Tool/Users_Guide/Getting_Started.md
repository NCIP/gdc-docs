# Getting Started

## The GDC Data Transfer Tool: An Overview

Raw sequence data, stored as BAM files, make up the bulk of data stored at the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC). The size of a single file can vary greatly. Most BAM files stored in the GDC are in the 50 MB - 40 GB size range, with some of the whole genome BAM files reaching sizes of 200-300 GB.

The GDC Data Transfer Tool provides an optimized method of transferring data to and from the GDC, and enables resumption of interrupted transfers.

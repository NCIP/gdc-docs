# Copy Number Variation Analysis Pipeline

## Introduction

The copy number variation (CNV) pipeline uses Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array data to identify genomic regions that are repeated and infer the copy number of these repeats. This pipeline is built onto the existing TCGA level 2 data generated by [Birdsuite](https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/medical-and-population-genetics/birdsuite/birdsuite) and uses the [DNAcopy](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DNAcopy.html) R-package to perform a circular binary segmentation (CBS) analysis [[1]](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/4/557.short). CBS translates noisy intensity measurements into chromosomal regions of equal copy number.  The final output files are segmented into genomic regions with the estimated copy number for each region. The GDC further transforms these copy number values into segment mean values, which are equal to log2(copy-number/ 2). Diploid regions will have a segment mean of zero, amplified regions will have positive values, and deletions will have negative values. The GRCh38 probe-set was produced by mapping probe sequences to the GRCh38 reference genome and can be downloaded at the [GDC Reference File Website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-harmonization-and-generation/gdc-reference-files).


## Data Processing Steps

A metadata preprocessing step is used to convert the GRCh37 (hg19) probe set coordinates to the newer GRCh38 (hg38) genome build coordinates. A minimum quality control step to verify that reference bases are consistent across two genome builds is used to filter out low quality liftover probe sets.

The [Copy Number Liftover Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=copy_number_liftover_workflow) uses the TCGA level 2 tangent.copynumber files described above. These files were generated by first normalizing array intensity values, estimating raw copy number, and performing tangent normalization, which subtracts variation that is found in a set of normal samples. Original array intensity values (TCGA level 1) are available in the [GDC Legacy Archive](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/) under the "Data Format: CEL" and "Platform: Affymetrix SNP 6.0" filters.

The Copy Number Liftover Workflow performs CBS analysis using the DNACopy R-package to process tangent normalized data into [Copy Number Segment](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=copy_number_segment) files, which associate contiguous chromosome regions with log2 ratio segment means in a tab-delimited format.  The number of probes with intensity values associated with each chromosome region is also reported (probes with no intensity values are not included in this count).  During copy number segmentation probe sets from Pseudo-Autosomal Regions (PARs) were removed from males and Y chromosome segments were removed from females.

Masked copy number segments are generated with the same method except that a filtering step is performed that removes Y chromosome and probe sets that were previously indicated to have frequent germline copy-number variation.

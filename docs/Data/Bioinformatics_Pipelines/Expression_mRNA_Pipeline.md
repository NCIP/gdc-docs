# mRNA Analysis Pipeline

## Introduction
The GDC mRNA quantification analysis pipeline measures gene and exon level expression in [HT-Seq](http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) raw mapping count, Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) and FPKM-UQ (upper quartile normalization).  These values are generated through this pipeline by first aligning reads to the GRCh38 [reference genome](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/download-gdc-reference-files) and then by quantifying the mapped reads.  To facilitate harmonization across samples, all RNA-Seq reads are treated as unstranded during analyses.    


## Data Processing Steps

### RNA Alignment Workflow
The mRNA Analysis pipeline begins with the [Alignment Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=alignment_workflow), which is performed using a 2-pass method with [STAR](http://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/gingeraslab/www-data/dobin/STAR/STAR.posix/doc/STARmanual.pdf). STAR aligns each [read group](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=read_group) separately and then merges the resulting alignments into one. Following the methods used by the International Cancer Genome Consortium [ICGC](https://icgc.org/) ([github](https://github.com/akahles/icgc_rnaseq_align)), the 2-pass method includes a splice junction detection step, which is used to generate the final alignment. This workflow outputs a BAM file, which contains both aligned and unaligned reads. Quality assessment is performed pre-alignment with [FASTQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and post-alignment with [RNA-SeQC](https://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/rna-seqc) and [Picard Tools](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

| I/O | Entity | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Input | [Submitted Unaligned Reads](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=submitted_unaligned_reads) or [Submitted Aligned Reads](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=submitted_aligned_reads) |  FASTQ or BAM |
| Output | [Aligned Reads](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=aligned_reads) | BAM  |


### mRNA Expression Workflow
Following alignment, BAM files are processed through the [RNA Expression Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=rna_expression_workflow).

First the BAM files are filtered for reads that were aligned to protein-coding genes using the [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net) view function. The reads mapped to each protein-coding gene are enumerated using HT-Seq count. The number of reads mapped to each gene (raw count), gene length and the total number of reads mapped to protein-coding genes are then used to calculate normalized expression levels using FPKM and FPKM-UQ (upper quartile normalization). Expression values are provided in a tab-delimited format. [GENCODE v22](http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/22.html) was used for gene annotation.

## File Access and Availability

To facilitate the use of harmonized data in user-created pipelines, RNA-Seq gene expression is accessible in the GDC Data Portal at several intermediate steps in the pipeline. Below is a description of each type of file available for download in the GDC Data Portal.   

| Type | Description | Format |
|---|---|---|
| RNA-Seq Alignment | RNA-Seq reads that have been aligned to the GRCh38 build. Reads that were not aligned are included to facilitate the availability of raw read sets.  |  BAM |
| Raw Read Counts | The number of reads aligned to each protein-coding gene, calculated by HT-Seq. |  TXT |
| FPKM | A normalized expression value that takes into account each protein-coding gene length and the number of reads mappable to all protein-coding genes. |  TXT |
| FPKM-UQ | A normalized raw read count in which gene expression values, in FPKM, are divided by the 75th percentile value. |  TXT |

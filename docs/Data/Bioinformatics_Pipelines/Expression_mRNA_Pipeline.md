# mRNA Analysis Pipeline

## Introduction
The GDC mRNA quantification analysis pipeline measures gene level expression in [HT-Seq](http://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) raw read count, Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), and FPKM-UQ (upper quartile normalization). These values are generated through this pipeline by first aligning reads to the GRCh38 [reference genome](https://gdc.cancer.gov/download-gdc-reference-files) and then by quantifying the mapped reads. To facilitate harmonization across samples, all RNA-Seq reads are treated as unstranded during analyses.    

## Data Processing Steps

### RNA-Seq Alignment Workflow
The mRNA Analysis pipeline begins with the [Alignment Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=alignment_workflow), which is performed using a two-pass method with [STAR](http://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/gingeraslab/www-data/dobin/STAR/STAR.posix/doc/STARmanual.pdf). STAR aligns each [read group](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=read_group) separately and then merges the resulting alignments into one. Following the methods used by the International Cancer Genome Consortium [ICGC](https://icgc.org/) ([github](https://github.com/akahles/icgc_rnaseq_align)), the two-pass method includes a splice junction detection step, which is used to generate the final alignment. This workflow outputs a genomic BAM file, which contains both aligned and unaligned reads. Quality assessment is performed pre-alignment with [FASTQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and post-alignment with [Picard Tools](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

Files that were processed after Data Release 14 have associated transcriptomic and chimeric alignments in addition to the genomic alignment detailed above. This only applies to aliquots with at least one set of paired-end reads. The chimeric BAM file contains reads that were mapped to different chromosomes or strands (fusion alignments). The genomic alignment files contain chimeric and unaligned reads to facilitate the retrieval of all original reads. The transcriptomic alignment reports aligned reads with transcript coordinates rather than genomic coordinates. The transcriptomic alignment is also sorted differently to facilitate downstream analyses. BAM index file pairing is not supported by this method of sorting, which does not allow for BAM slicing on these alignments. The splice-junction file for these alignments are also available.

### mRNA Expression Workflow
Following alignment, BAM files are processed through the [RNA Expression Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=rna_expression_workflow) to determine RNA expression levels.

The reads mapped to each gene are enumerated using HT-Seq-Count. Expression values are provided in a tab-delimited format. [GENCODE v22](http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/22.html) was used for gene annotation.

Files that were processed after Data Release 14 have an additional set of read counts that were produced by STAR during the alignment step.

## mRNA Expression HT-Seq Normalization

RNA-Seq expression level read counts produced by HT-Seq are normalized using two similar methods: FPKM and FPKM-UQ. Normalized values should be used only within the context of the entire gene set. Users are encouraged to normalize raw read count values if a subset of genes is investigated.

### FPKM

The Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) calculation normalizes read count by dividing it by the gene length and the total number of reads mapped to protein-coding genes.

### Upper Quartile FPKM

The upper quartile FPKM (FPKM-UQ) is a modified FPKM calculation in which the total protein-coding read count is replaced by the 75th percentile read count value for the sample.

### Calculations

[![FPKM Calculations](images/Calc_FPKM_andUQ.png)](images/fpkm.gif "Click to see the full image.")

- __RC<sub>g</sub>:__ Number of reads mapped to the gene
- __RC<sub>pc</sub>:__ Number of reads mapped to all protein-coding genes
- __RC<sub>g75</sub>:__ The 75th percentile read count value for genes in the sample
- __L:__ Length of the gene in base pairs; Calculated as the sum of all exons in a gene

__Note:__ The read count is multiplied by a scalar (10<sup>9</sup>) during normalization to account for the kilobase and 'million mapped reads' units.

### Examples

__Sample 1: Gene A__

* Gene length: 3,000 bp
* 1,000 reads mapped to Gene A
* 1,000,000 reads mapped to all protein-coding regions
* Read count in Sample 1 for 75th percentile gene: 2,000

__FPKM for Gene A__ = (1,000)\*(10^9)/[(3,000)\*(1,000,000)] = __333.33__

__FPKM-UQ for Gene A__ = (1,000)\*(10^9)/[(3,000)\*(2,000)] = __166,666.67__

| RNA-Seq Alignment | RNA-Seq reads that have been aligned to the GRCh38 build. Reads that were not aligned are included to facilitate the availability of raw read sets  |  BAM |
| HT-Seq Read Counts | The number of reads aligned to each gene, calculated by HT-Seq |  TXT |
| STAR Read Counts | The number of reads aligned to each gene, calculated by STAR |  TSV |
| FPKM | A normalized expression value that takes into account each gene length and the number of reads mapped to all protein-coding genes |  TXT |

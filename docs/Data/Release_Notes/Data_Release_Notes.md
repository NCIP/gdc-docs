## Data Release 13.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: September 27, 2018

### New updates

1. Three new projects are released to the GDC (VAREPOP-APOLLO (phs001374), CTSP-DLBCL1 (phs001184), NCICCR-DLBCL (phs001444) <!--SPT-136,SPT-145,SPT-84-->
2. TARGET WGS alignments are released. VCFs will be provided in a later release <!--DAT-1699-->
3. Clinical data was harmonized with ICD-O-3 terminology for TCGA properties case.primary_site, case.disease_type, diagnosis.primary_diagnosis, diagnosis.site_of_resection_or_biopsy, diagnosis.tissue_or_organ_of_origin <!--DAT-1512-->
4. Redaction annotations applied to 11 aliquots in TCGA-DLBC <!--DAT-1169, Data-871-->
5. Redaction annotations applied to incorrectly trimmed miRNA file in the Legacy Achive <!--SV-653-->

A complete list of files for DR13.0 are listed for the GDC Data Portal and the GDC Legacy Archive are found below:

* [gdc_manifest_20180927_data_release_13.0_active.txt.gz](gdc_manifest_20180927_data_release_13.0_active.txt.gz)
* [gdc_manifest_20180927_data_release_13.0_legacy.txt.gz](gdc_manifest_20180927_data_release_13.0_legacy.txt.gz).


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* 253 files Copy Number Segment and Masked Copy Number Segment files were released.  These were skipped in DR 12.0 <!--DAT-1404-->
* 36 Diagnostic TCGA slides were released.  They were skipped in DR 12.0  <!--SV-1109-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* TARGET CGI BAMs in the Legacy Archive for the following aliquots should not be used because they were not repaired and concatenated into their original composite BAM files by CGHub.
    * TARGET-20-PASJGZ-04A-02D
    * TARGET-30-PAPTLY-01A-01D
    * TARGET-20-PAEIKD-09A-01D
    * TARGET-20-PASMYS-14A-02D
    * TARGET-20-PAMYAS-14A-02D
    * TARGET-10-PAPZST-09A-01D
* Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release <!--DAT-1589-->
* 74 Diagnostic TCGA slides are attached to a portion rather than a sample like the rest of the diagnostic slides. The reflects how these original samples were handled. <!--SV-1111-->
* 11 bam files for TARGET-NBL RNA-Seq are not available in the GDC Data portal <!--DAT-1476-->
* Two tissue slide images are unavailable for download from GDC Data Portal <!--DAT-1439-->
* The raw and annotated VarScan VCF files for aliquot `TCGA-VR-A8ET-01A-11D-A403-09` are not available. These VCFs files will be replaced in a later release.
<!--TT-602, DAT-1489-->
* There are 5051 TARGET files for which `experimental_strategy`, `data_format`, `platform`, and `data_subtype` are blank <!--SV-944-->
* There are two cases with identical submitter_id `TARGET-10-PARUYU` <!--SV-940-->
* TARGET-MDLS cases do not have disease_type or primary_site populated <!--SV-939-->
* Some TARGET cases are missing `days_to_last_follow_up` <!--SV-934-->
* Some TARGET cases are missing `age_at_diagnosis` <!--SV-933-->
* Some TARGET files are not connected to all related aliquots <!--SV-929-->
* Samples of TARGET sample_type `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow` are mislabeled as `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood`.  A workaround is to look at the sample barcode, which is -04 for `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow`. (e.g. `TARGET-20-PAMYAS-04A-03R`) <!--SV-918-->
* FM-AD clinical and biospecimen supplement files have incorrect data format.  They are listed as XLSX, but are in fact TSV files. <!--DAT-1123-->
* Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
* Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
* The latest TARGET data is not yet available at the GDC.  For the complete and latest data, please see the [TARGET Data Matrix](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/data-matrix).  Data that is not present or is not the most up to date includes:
    *  All microarray data and metadata
    *  All sequencing analyzed data and metadata
    *  1180 of 12063 sequencing runs of raw data
* Demographic information for some TARGET patients is incorrect.  The correct information can be found in the associated clinical supplement file.  Impacted patients are TARGET-50-PAJNUS. <!--SV-710-->
* Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* No data from TARGET-MDLS is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->
* SDF Files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-332-->
* Two biotab files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-535, DAT-493-->
* SDRF files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-288-->
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->
* Tumor grade property is not populated <!--SV-585-->
* Progression_or_recurrence property is not populated <!--SV-584-->




## Data Release 12.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: June 13, 2018

### New updates

1. Updated clinical and biospecimen XML files for TCGA cases are available in the GDC Data Portal. Equivalent Legacy Archive files may no longer be up to date. <!--TT-328-->

2.  Clinical data added for TARGET ALL P1 and P2 <!--DAT-197-->
3.  Pathology reports now have submitter IDs as assigned by the BCR <!--DAT-81-->
4.  TARGET Data refresh
    * Most recent biospecimen and clinical information from the TARGET DCC. New imported files are listed [here](DR5.0_changes_TARGET.xlsx)
    * Updated indexed biospecimen and clinical metadata
    * Updated SRA XMLs files
    * Does not include updates to TARGET NBL <!--SV-585-->

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

1. Missing cases from TCGA-LAML were added to Legacy Archive <!--DAT-272,DAT-324-->
2. Biotab files are now linked to Projects and Cases in Legacy Archive <!--SV-303,DAT-28-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
* Some validated somatic mutations may not be present in open-access MAF files.  When creating open-access MAF files from the protected versions we are extremely conservative in removing potential germline variants.  Our approach is to remove all mutations that are present in dbSNP.  In a subsequent release we will provide updated open-access MAF files, which preserve variants found in MC3 or a TCGA validation study.  Please review the protected MAF files in the GDC Data Portal if you are unable to find your mutation in the open-access files.
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* MAF Column #109 "FILTER" entries are separated by both commas and semi-colons. <!-- PGDC-2589 -->
* TARGET-AML is undergoing reorganization.  Pending reorganization, cases from this projects may not contain many clinical, biospecimen, or genomic data files.
* No data from TARGET-MLDS is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->

4.  Updated VCFs and MAF files are available for MuTect2 pipeline to compensate for WGA-related false positive indels.  See additional information on that change [here](https://gdc.cancer.gov/content/mutect2-insertion-artifacts). A listing of replaced files is provided [here](GDC_Data_v4_mapping_of_replaced_Mutect2_MAF_and_VCF_files.zip). <!-- Dat-145, Dat-260 -->
5.  Added submitter_id for Pathology Reports in Legacy Archive <!--DAT-81-->

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* None

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Some validated somatic mutations may not be present in open-access MAF files.  When creating open-access MAF files from the protected versions we are extremely conservative in removing potential germline variants.  Our approach is to remove all mutations that are present in dbSNP.  In a subsequent release we will provide updated open-access MAF files, which preserve variants found in COSMIC or a TCGA validation study.  Please review the protected MAF files in the GDC Data Portal if you are unable to find your mutation in the open-access files.
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* MAF Column #109 "FILTER" entries are separated by both commas and semi-colons. <!-- PGDC-2589 -->
* TARGET-AML is undergoing reorganization.  Pending reorganization, cases from this projects may not contain many clinical, biospecimen, or genomic data files.
* No data from TARGET-MLDS is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->
* SDF Files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-332-->
* There are 200 cases from TCGA-LAML that do not appear in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-327-->
* Biotab files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-303-->
* SDRF files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-288-->
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->

## Data Release 3.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: September 16, 2016

### New updates

1.  CCLE data now available (in the Legacy Archive only)
2.  BMI calculation is corrected
3.  Slide is now categorized as a Biospecimen entity

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* BMI calculation is corrected

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Insertions called for tumor samples that underwent whole genome amplification may be of lower quality.  Whether a sample underwent this process can be found in the analyte_type property within analyte and aliquot. TCGA analyte type can be also identified in the 20th character of TCGA barcode, at which "W" corresponds to WGA.<!--BINF-6-->
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Public MAFs (those with germline variants removed) are only available for MuTect2 pipeline.  MAFs for other pipelines are forthcoming.  
* MAF Column #109 "FILTER" entries are separated by both commas and semi-colons. <!-- PGDC-2589 -->
* TARGET-AML and TARGET-ALL projects are undergoing reorganization.  Pending reorganization, cases from these projects may not contain many clinical, biospecimen, or genomic data files.
* No data from TARGET-PPTP is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->

## Data Release 2.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: August 9, 2016


### New updates

1.  Additional data, previously available via CGHub and the TCGA DCC, is now available in the GDC
2.  Better linking between files and their associated projects and cases in the Legacy Archive
3.  MAF files are now available in the GDC Data Portal

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Insertions called for tumor samples that underwent whole genome amplification may be of lower quality.  These are present in VCF and MAF files produced by the MuTect2 variant calling pipeline.  This information can be found in the analyte_type property within analyte and aliquot. TCGA analyte type can be also identified in the 20th character of TCGA barcode, at which "W" corresponds to WGA.<!--BINF-6-->

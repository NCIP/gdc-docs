* [gdc_manifest_20221212_data_release_36.0_active.tsv.gz](gdc_manifest_20221212_data_release_36.0_active.tsv.gz)

### Unavailable Files

* None


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* The copy number variation data is now available on the GDC Exploration portal.
* The mutations on GDC Exploration were re-built with the correct gene model.


### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Pathology reports do not have any associated case/biospecimen information in the portal. This information can be found in the reports themselves. <!--SV-2118-->  
* 397 alignments from the TCGA program were found to have contamination values over 0.04 ([alignment list](Contaminated_Alignments.dr32.tsv)). The ensemble MAFs produced by these alignments were removed from the Data Portal.
* One methylation aliquot from the TCGA-COAD project, TCGA-D5-6930-01A-11D-1926-05, was not added to the portal and will be added in a future release.
* The clinical supplement for TARGET-ALL-P1 is not currently available. It will be made available in a future release.
* The slide image viewer does not display properly for 14 slides, which are identified [here](missing_tiling.txt).  The full slide image can be downloaded as an SVS file.
* The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->
* Some tumor-only annotated VCFs (not raw VCFs) could have a small proportion of variants that appear twice.  Tumor-only annotated VCFs can be identified by searching for workflow "GATK4 MuTect2 Annotation" <!--SV-1425-->
* The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.
* Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release. <!--DAT-1589-->
* Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
* Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->
* TCGA Projects
    * Incorrect information about treatment may be included for patients within TCGA-HNSC and TCGA-LGG.  Please refer to the clinical XML for accurate information on treatment <!--DAT-2264, DAT-2265-->
    * 74 Diagnostic TCGA slides are attached to a portion rather than a sample like the rest of the diagnostic slides. The reflects how these original samples were handled. <!--SV-1111-->
    * Two tissue slide images are unavailable for download from GDC Data Portal <!--DAT-1439-->
    * The raw and annotated VarScan VCF files for aliquot `TCGA-VR-A8ET-01A-11D-A403-09` are not available. These VCFs files will be replaced in a later release.<!--TT-602, DAT-1489-->
    * Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
    * Tumor grade property is not populated <!--SV-585-->
    * Progression_or_recurrence property is not populated <!--SV-584-->
* TARGET projects
    * TARGET CGI BAMs in the Legacy Archive for the following aliquots should not be used because they were not repaired and concatenated into their original composite BAM files by CGHub.
        * TARGET-20-PASJGZ-04A-02D
        * TARGET-30-PAPTLY-01A-01D
        * TARGET-20-PAEIKD-09A-01D
        * TARGET-20-PASMYS-14A-02D
        * TARGET-20-PAMYAS-14A-02D
        * TARGET-10-PAPZST-09A-01D
    * 11 bam files for TARGET-NBL RNA-Seq are not available in the GDC Data portal <!--DAT-1476-->
    * There are 5051 TARGET files for which `experimental_strategy`, `data_format`, `platform`, and `data_subtype` are blank <!--SV-944-->
    * There are two cases with identical submitter_id `TARGET-10-PARUYU` <!--SV-940-->
    * Some TARGET cases are missing `days_to_last_follow_up` <!--SV-934-->
    * Some TARGET cases are missing `age_at_diagnosis` <!--SV-933-->
    * Some TARGET files are not connected to all related aliquots <!--SV-929-->
    * Samples of TARGET sample_type `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow` are mislabeled as `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood`.  A workaround is to look at the sample barcode, which is -04 for `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow`. (e.g. `TARGET-20-PAMYAS-04A-03R`) <!--SV-918-->
    * The latest TARGET data is not yet available at the GDC.  For the complete and latest data, please see the [TARGET Data Matrix](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/data-matrix).  Data that is not present or is not the most up to date includes:
        *  All microarray data and metadata
        *  All sequencing analyzed data and metadata
        *  1180 of 12063 sequencing runs of raw data
    * Demographic information for some TARGET patients is incorrect.  The correct information can be found in the associated clinical supplement file.  Impacted patients are TARGET-50-PAJNUS. <!--SV-710-->
    * No data from TARGET-MDLS is available.
* Issues in the Legacy Archive
    * The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->
    * SDF Files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-332-->
    * Two biotab files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-535, DAT-493-->
    * SDRF files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-288-->
    * TARGET-MDLS cases do not have disease_type or primary_site populated <!--SV-939-->

## Data Release 35.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: September 28, 2022

### New Updates

* The SomaticSniper variant calling pipeline was deprecated.  To support this, the following changes were made:
    * All SomaticSniper files no longer appear in the portal, but still can be downloaded using the Data Transfer Tool or API using the original UUID.
    * The aggregated somatic mutation and masked somatic mutation files (multi-caller MAFs) have been replaced to reflect the absence of variants from the SomaticSniper pipeline.
    * The mutations on the exploration portal reflect the above-mentioned masked somatic mutation files.
* 10 snRNA-Seq samples were released from the CPTAC-3 project.
* Additional RNA-Seq samples from 2,082 additional cases are now available for the TARGET-AML project.
* Demographic data has been added for 94 cases in TARGET-ALL-P2 and TARGET-ALL-P3 projects. A list of the updated cases can be found
[here](TARGET_demo_update.dr35.tsv).

A complete list of files included in the GDC Data Portal can be found below:

* [gdc_manifest_20220928_data_release_35.0_active.tsv.gz](gdc_manifest_20220928_data_release_35.0_active.tsv.gz)

### Unavailable Files

* None


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* Data from two HCMI-CMDC aliquots (HCM-BROD-0100-C15-85A-01D-A786-36 and HCM-BROD-0679-C43-85M-01D-A80U-36) were incorrectly selected for inclusion into the Exploration Page in Data Release 32 and has been replaced with the correct aliquots (HCM-BROD-0100-C15-01A-11D-A786-36 and HCM-BROD-0679-C43-06A-11D-A80U-36). <!--DAT-3220-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* The mutations on GDC Exploration were built with an incorrect gene model.
    * The mutations are still correct in terms of the gene affected, coordinates, DNA changes, amino acid changes, and impact.
    * Mutations associated with genes that were present in GENCODE v36 and not GENCODE v22 are not displayed. This affects less than 1% of mutations.
    * Files downloaded from the the GDC Repository are not affected by this issue.  This only affects mutations that are downloaded from GDC Exploration.
* Pathology reports do not have any associated case/biospecimen information in the portal. This information can be found in the reports themselves. <!--SV-2118-->  
* 397 alignments from the TCGA program were found to have contamination values over 0.04 ([alignment list](Contaminated_Alignments.dr32.tsv)). The ensemble MAFs produced by these alignments were removed from the Data Portal.

* The clinical supplement for TARGET-ALL-P1 is not currently available. It will be made available in a future release.
* Copy number variations currently do not appear in the Exploration page.  This will be restored in a future release.
* Mutations from SomaticSniper were erroneously labelled as LOH (loss of heterozygosity). This affects the VCF files, MAF files, and may cause SomaticSniper mutations to be absent from ensemble MAFs.
* The slide image viewer does not display properly for 14 slides, which are identified [here](missing_tiling.txt).  The full slide image can be downloaded as an SVS file.
* The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->

## Data Release 33.1

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: May 31, 2022

### New updates

* None, see "Bugs Fixed Since Last Release" section below.

A complete list of files included in the GDC Data Portal can be found below:

### Unavailable Files

* None


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* 32 cases from the EXCEPTIONAL_RESPONDERS-ER project were released as they were missing from the previous release.
* All mutations from EXCEPTIONAL_RESPONDERS-ER in the exploration portal come from WXS data, whereas they were previously a mixture of WXS and Targeted Sequencing.

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Pathology reports do not have any associated case/biospecimen information in the portal. This information can be found in the reports themselves. <!--SV-2118-->  
* 397 alignments from the TCGA program were found to have contamination values over 0.04 ([alignment list](Contaminated_Alignments.dr32.tsv)). The ensemble MAFs produced by these alignments were removed from the Data Portal.
* One methylation aliquot from the TCGA-COAD project, TCGA-D5-6930-01A-11D-1926-05, was not added to the portal and will be added in a future release.
* The clinical supplement for TARGET-ALL-P1 is not currently available. It will be made available in a future release.
* Copy number variations currently do not appear in the Exploration page.  This will be restored in a future release.
* Mutations from SomaticSniper were erroneously labelled as LOH (loss of heterozygosity). This affects the VCF files, MAF files, and may cause SomaticSniper mutations to be absent from ensemble MAFs.
* The slide image viewer does not display properly for 14 slides, which are identified [here](missing_tiling.txt).  The full slide image can be downloaded as an SVS file.
* The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->
* Some tumor-only annotated VCFs (not raw VCFs) could have a small proportion of variants that appear twice.  Tumor-only annotated VCFs can be identified by searching for workflow "GATK4 MuTect2 Annotation" <!--SV-1425-->

## Data Release 32.0

* __GDC Product__: Data - GENCODE v36 Release
* __Release Date__: March 29, 2022

### New updates

#### New data files
1.  The following data types have been replaced with new GENCODE v36 versions
    * RNA-Seq: all files, including alignments, gene expression files, and transcript fusion files.
    * WXS and Targeted Sequencing: annotated VCFs, single-caller MAFs, Ensemble MAFs.
    * WGS: BEDPE-format structural variants and gene-level copy number variants.
    * GENIE Targeted Sequencing files.
    * FM-AD Targeted Sequencing files.
        * The primary-site-level FM-AD MAF files have been replaced with aliquot-level MAF files.
1. RNA-Seq STAR-Counts files now contain additional normalized counts such as FPKM, FPKM-UQ, and TPM.
1. All WXS files for TCGA have been replaced with new versions. Alignments will contain QC metrics and variants were produced using the same pipelines as all other GDC projects.
1. TCGA RNA-Seq has been changed to contain three alignments (genomic, transcriptome, and chimeric), STAR-counts files, and transcript fusion files for each aliquot.
1. The project-level MAFs in TCGA and FM-AD have been replaced with aliquot-level MAFs.
1. GENCODE v22 derived files (not BAM) that no longer appear in the portal will be downloadable as previous versions of v36 files.  
1. Methylation data produced from the SeSAMe pipeline is now available for all TCGA projects.
1. Note that miRNA-Seq data remains unchanged. The miRNA-Seq pipeline uses the miRBase database, which is not affected by the GENCODE version change.
1. A set of manifests were generated at the project-level that map each v22 file to its corresponding v36 file.  These can be used to help users transition from v22 to v36 and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/NCI-GDC/gdc-docs/tree/develop/docs/Data/Release_Notes/GCv36_Manifests).

#### Removed data files and pipelines
1. Files from the HTSeq pipeline are no longer supported and will no longer appear in the portal. Normalized counts can now be found in the STAR-Counts files.  
1. Files that originated from the methylation liftover pipeline are no longer supported and will no longer appear in the portal.
1. GENCODE v22 BAM files that no longer appear in the portal will be available for six months past this release. They may not be available after that.
1. New variant calling tumor-normal pairing was implemented in TCGA, which results in certain aliquots no longer being available as a v36 version (see the aliquots labeled "Unpaired Aliquots" [here](Removed_Aliquots.tsv)).
1. Some aliquots failed harmonization when the new v36 gene model was used, which results in some new versions no longer being available (see the aliquots labeled "Failed Harmonization" [here](Removed_Aliquots.tsv)).
1. Some aliquots were found to contain a cross-patient contamination level of over 0.04 as measured by GATK4 CalculateContamination (see the aliquots labeled "Contamination" [here](Removed_Aliquots.tsv)).  

#### Data Portal Exploration Data
1. The Data Portal Exploration Page is now populated based on open-access mutations from analyses that used GENCODE v36.
1. Mutations from SomaticSniper will not appear on the Exploration page.
1. Due to the copy number variation pipeline transition from GISTIC to ASCAT, the CNV data was not included in the GDC Exploration page. This will be replaced in a future release once visualization of the new pipeline is fully assessed.
1. The TCGA program mutations have been processed using the same pipeline as all other projects, which resulted in a 26% reduction in the number of open-access mutations. Some points on this change are listed below with TCGA-BRCA as the benchmark project:
    * 97% of the previously released open-access mutations are still discoverable in the new GDC controlled-access MAFs. This number increases to 99.95% when focusing only on mutations that were also called by [MC3](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas).
    * Somatic mutations will now be removed from the Data Portal Exploration Page unless they are detected by more than one variant calling software. This accounts for 40% of the total reduction.
    * Somatic mutations will now be removed from the Data Portal Exploration Page if they are detected outside of the target capture region, while previously out-of-target mutations detected from the TCGA Gene Annotation File (GAF) regions were allowed. This accounts for 36% of the total reduction.  
    * Some TCGA-specific variant-rescue steps have been removed in favor of a more robust and uniform filtering pipeline.
    * Some other minor changes due to updates in the gene model or other databases (e.g., the ExAC germline variant database was replaced with gnomAD in DR32).


A complete list of files for this release are listed for the GDC Data Portal and the GDC Legacy Archive are found below:

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* None

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* 397 alignments from the TCGA program were found to have contamination values over 0.04 ([alignment list](Contaminated_Alignments.dr32.tsv)). The ensemble MAFs produced by these alignments were removed from the Data Portal.
* One methylation aliquot from the TCGA-COAD project, TCGA-D5-6930-01A-11D-1926-05, was not added to the portal and will be added in a future release.
* The clinical supplement for TARGET-ALL-P1 is not currently available. It will be made available in a future release.
* Copy number variations currently do not appear in the Exploration page.  This will be restored in a future release.
* Mutations from SomaticSniper were erroneously labelled as LOH (loss of heterozygosity). This affects the VCF files, MAF files, and may cause SomaticSniper mutations to be absent from ensemble MAFs.
* The slide image viewer does not display properly for 14 slides, which are identified [here](missing_tiling.txt).  The full slide image can be downloaded as an SVS file.
* The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->
* Some tumor-only annotated VCFs (not raw VCFs) could have a small proportion of variants that appear twice.  Tumor-only annotated VCFs can be identified by searching for workflow "GATK4 MuTect2 Annotation" <!--SV-1425-->
* The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.

## Data Release 31.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: October 29, 2021

### New updates

1.  TCGA Slide Images:
    * All TCGA slide images that were removed earlier this year have been restored.
    * Note that the UUIDs for most TCGA slide images have changed.  Older manifest files may not work when downloading slide images.
2. CPTAC-3 clinical data has been refreshed and includes new follow up entities.
3. REBC-THYR
    * The clinical and biospecimen XML files were removed as they were not intended for release in DR 30.
    * The case REBC-ADL5 was added, which includes one WGS pair.

A complete list of files for this release are listed for the GDC Data Portal and the GDC Legacy Archive are found below:

* One file from a previous version of the methylation pipeline appeared in the data portal (bd2f864a-3f00-47b5-815d-bd01ca21ef61; CPTAC-3).  This file should no longer appear in the data portal. <!--SV-2012-->

### Known Issues and Workarounds

    ### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

    *  None

    ### Known Issues and Workarounds

    * The aggregated and masked MAF files for seven pancreatic cases in CPTAC-3 do not appear in the Data Portal. See below for download instructions.
        - [This manifest](CPTAC-3_7Cases-WXS-MAFs_GDC-Manifest.txt) can be used to download the files.  
        - To download the raw aggregated MAF files, dbGaP access to CPTAC-3 (phs001287) is required.  The masked MAF files are open-access.
        - The seven cases are as follows: C3L-04027, C3L-04080, C3N-02585, C3N-02768, C3N-02971, C3N-03754, and C3N-03839. The case the each file is associated with is denoted in the manifest.
    * The RNA-Seq data files for the seven normal pancreatic cases in CPTAC-3 do not appear in the Data Portal. See below for download instructions.
        - [This manifest](CPTAC-3_7CasesRNASeq_GDC-Manifest.txt) can be used to download the files.  
        - To download the alignments or splice-junction files, dbGaP access to CPTAC-3 (phs001287) is required.  The other gene expression files are open-access.
        - The seven cases are as follows: C3L-03513, C3L-07032, C3L-07033, C3L-07034, C3L-07035, C3L-07036, C3L-07037. The case the each file is associated with is denoted in the manifest.
    * The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->
    * Some tumor-only annotated VCFs (not raw VCFs) could have a small proportion of variants that appear twice.  Tumor-only annotated VCFs can be identified by searching for workflow "GATK4 MuTect2 Annotation" <!--SV-1425-->
    * The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.
    * Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release <!--DAT-1589-->
    * Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
    * Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
    * Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
    * BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
    * Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->
    * TCGA Projects
        * Incorrect information about treatment may be included for patients within TCGA-HNSC and TCGA-LGG.  Please refer to the clinical XML for accurate information on treatment <!--DAT-2264, DAT-2265-->
        * 74 Diagnostic TCGA slides are attached to a portion rather than a sample like the rest of the diagnostic slides. The reflects how these original samples were handled. <!--SV-1111-->
        * Two tissue slide images are unavailable for download from GDC Data Portal <!--DAT-1439-->
        * The raw and annotated VarScan VCF files for aliquot `TCGA-VR-A8ET-01A-11D-A403-09` are not available. These VCFs files will be replaced in a later release.<!--TT-602, DAT-1489-->
        * Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
        * Tumor grade property is not populated <!--SV-585-->
        * Progression_or_recurrence property is not populated <!--SV-584-->
    * TARGET projects
        * TARGET CGI BAMs in the Legacy Archive for the following aliquots should not be used because they were not repaired and concatenated into their original composite BAM files by CGHub.
            * TARGET-20-PASJGZ-04A-02D
            * TARGET-30-PAPTLY-01A-01D

        * 11 bam files for TARGET-NBL RNA-Seq are not available in the GDC Data portal <!--DAT-1476-->
        * There are 5051 TARGET files for which `experimental_strategy`, `data_format`, `platform`, and `data_subtype` are blank <!--SV-944-->

        * Some TARGET cases are missing `age_at_diagnosis` <!--SV-933-->
        * Some TARGET files are not connected to all related aliquots <!--SV-929-->
        * Samples of TARGET sample_type `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow` are mislabeled as `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood`.  A workaround is to look at the sample barcode, which is -04 for `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow`. (e.g. `TARGET-20-PAMYAS-04A-03R`) <!--SV-918-->
        * The latest TARGET data is not yet available at the GDC.  For the complete and latest data, please see the [TARGET Data Matrix](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/data-matrix).  Data that is not present or is not the most up to date includes:

    ### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

    *  A few supplements from CGCI-BLGSP are now associated with their correct versions. <!--SV-1709-->

    ### Known Issues and Workarounds

    * Currently the CPTAC-3 HNSCC cohort does not appear when the "Head and Neck" primary site is selected from the GDC home page. This cohort can be queried by clicking [here](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=cases&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.primary_site%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22other%20and%20ill-defined%20sites%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.project_id%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22CPTAC-3%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D)
    * The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->

    * The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.
    * Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release <!--DAT-1589-->
    * Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
    * Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
    * Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

*  None

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* The Copy Number Estimate files in GENIE are labeled on the portal as TXT while the files are actually in TSV format.  <!--DAT-2728-->
* 6 of the HCMI-CMDC cases are missing clinical nodes <!--SV-1660-->
    * HCM-CSHL-0060-C18
    * HCM-CSHL-0089-C25
    * HCM-CSHL-0090-C25
    * HCM-CSHL-0092-C25
    * HCM-CSHL-0091-C25
    * HCM-CSHL-0057-C18
* Some tumor-only annotated VCFs (not raw VCFs) could have a small proportion of variants that appear twice.  Tumor-only annotated VCFs can be identified by searching for workflow "GATK4 MuTect2 Annotation" <!--SV-1425-->
* The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.
* Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release <!--DAT-1589-->
* Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
* Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->
* TCGA Projects
    * Incorrect information about treatment may be included for patients within TCGA-HNSC and TCGA-LGG.  Please refer to the clinical XML for accurate information on treatment <!--DAT-2264, DAT-2265-->
    * 74 Diagnostic TCGA slides are attached to a portion rather than a sample like the rest of the diagnostic slides. The reflects how these original samples were handled. <!--SV-1111-->
    * Two tissue slide images are unavailable for download from GDC Data Portal <!--DAT-1439-->
    * The raw and annotated VarScan VCF files for aliquot `TCGA-VR-A8ET-01A-11D-A403-09` are not available. These VCFs files will be replaced in a later release.<!--TT-602, DAT-1489-->

* The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.
* Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release <!--DAT-1589-->
* Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
* Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->
* TCGA Projects
    * Incorrect information about treatment may be included for patients within TCGA-HNSC and TCGA-LGG.  Please refer to the clinical XML for accurate information on treatment <!--DAT-2264, DAT-2265-->
    * 74 Diagnostic TCGA slides are attached to a portion rather than a sample like the rest of the diagnostic slides. The reflects how these original samples were handled. <!--SV-1111-->
    * Two tissue slide images are unavailable for download from GDC Data Portal <!--DAT-1439-->
    * The raw and annotated VarScan VCF files for aliquot `TCGA-VR-A8ET-01A-11D-A403-09` are not available. These VCFs files will be replaced in a later release.<!--TT-602, DAT-1489-->
    * Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
    * Tumor grade property is not populated <!--SV-585-->
    * Progression_or_recurrence property is not populated <!--SV-584-->

    * 11 bam files for TARGET-NBL RNA-Seq are not available in the GDC Data portal <!--DAT-1476-->
    * There are 5051 TARGET files for which `experimental_strategy`, `data_format`, `platform`, and `data_subtype` are blank <!--SV-944-->
    * There are two cases with identical submitter_id `TARGET-10-PARUYU` <!--SV-940-->
    * Some TARGET cases are missing `days_to_last_follow_up` <!--SV-934-->
    * Some TARGET cases are missing `age_at_diagnosis` <!--SV-933-->
    * Some TARGET files are not connected to all related aliquots <!--SV-929-->
    * Samples of TARGET sample_type `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow` are mislabeled as `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood`.  A workaround is to look at the sample barcode, which is -04 for `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow`. (e.g. `TARGET-20-PAMYAS-04A-03R`) <!--SV-918-->
    * The latest TARGET data is not yet available at the GDC.  For the complete and latest data, please see the [TARGET Data Matrix](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/data-matrix).  Data that is not present or is not the most up to date includes:

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

*  None

### Known Issues and Workarounds


* The read alignment end coordinates in the x.isoform.quantification.txt files produced by the miRNA pipeline are exclusive (i.e. offset by 1) for all TCGA miRNA legacy (GRCh37/hg19) and current harmonized (GRCh38/hg38) miRNA data.  This error has no impact on miRNA alignment or quantification - only the coordinates reported in the quantification file.
* Some miRNA files with QC failed reads were not swapped in DR11.0.  361 aliquots remain to be swapped in a later release <!--DAT-1589-->
* Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
* Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->
* TCGA Projects
    * Incorrect information about treatment may be included for patients within TCGA-HNSC and TCGA-LGG.  Please refer to the clinical XML for accurate information on treatment <!--DAT-2264, DAT-2265-->
    * 74 Diagnostic TCGA slides are attached to a portion rather than a sample like the rest of the diagnostic slides. The reflects how these original samples were handled. <!--SV-1111-->
    * Two tissue slide images are unavailable for download from GDC Data Portal <!--DAT-1439-->
    * The raw and annotated VarScan VCF files for aliquot `TCGA-VR-A8ET-01A-11D-A403-09` are not available. These VCFs files will be replaced in a later release.<!--TT-602, DAT-1489-->
    * Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
    * Tumor grade property is not populated <!--SV-585-->
    * Progression_or_recurrence property is not populated <!--SV-584-->
* TARGET projects
    * TARGET ALL-P3 RNA-Seq results from DR14 are missing ~18% of reads.  Downsampling appears to be completely random and count files have a very high correlation (>99.99%) with complete data. New versions of these files will be created that include the entire set of reads.
    * TARGET CGI BAMs in the Legacy Archive for the following aliquots should not be used because they were not repaired and concatenated into their original composite BAM files by CGHub.

    * There are 5051 TARGET files for which `experimental_strategy`, `data_format`, `platform`, and `data_subtype` are blank <!--SV-944-->
    * There are two cases with identical submitter_id `TARGET-10-PARUYU` <!--SV-940-->
    * Some TARGET cases are missing `days_to_last_follow_up` <!--SV-934-->
    * Some TARGET cases are missing `age_at_diagnosis` <!--SV-933-->
    * Some TARGET files are not connected to all related aliquots <!--SV-929-->
    * Samples of TARGET sample_type `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow` are mislabeled as `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood`.  A workaround is to look at the sample barcode, which is -04 for `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow`. (e.g. `TARGET-20-PAMYAS-04A-03R`) <!--SV-918-->
    * The latest TARGET data is not yet available at the GDC.  For the complete and latest data, please see the [TARGET Data Matrix](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/data-matrix).  Data that is not present or is not the most up to date includes:

A complete list of files for DR9.0 are listed [here](gdc_manifest_20171024_data_release_9.0_active.txt.gz).

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

None

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* miRNA alignments include QC failed reads.  
* Samples of TARGET sample_type `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow` are mislabeled as `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood`.  A workaround is to look at the sample barcode, which is -04 for `Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow`. (e.g. `TARGET-20-PAMYAS-04A-03R`) <!--SV-918-->
* FM-AD clinical and biospecimen supplement files have incorrect data format.  They are listed as XLSX, but are in fact TSV files. <!--DAT-1123-->
* Mutation frequency may be underestimated when using MAF files for genes that overlap other genes.  This is because MAF files only record one gene per variant.
* Most intronic mutations are removed for MAF generation.  However, validated variants may rescue these in some cases.  Therefore intronic mutations in MAF files are not representative of those called by mutation callers.
* The latest TARGET data is not yet available at the GDC.  For the complete and latest data, please see the [TARGET Data Matrix](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/data-matrix).  Data that is not present or is not the most up to date includes:
    *  All microarray data and metadata
    *  All sequencing analyzed data and metadata
    *  1180 of 12063 sequencing runs of raw data
* Demographic information for some TARGET patients is incorrect.  The correct information can be found in the associated clinical supplement file.  Impacted patients are TARGET-50-PAJNUS. <!--SV-710-->
* There are 11 cases in project TCGA-DLBC that are known to have incorrect WXS data in the GDC Data Portal.  Impacted cases are listed below.  This affects the BAMs and VCFs associated with these cases in the GDC Data Portal.  Corrected BAMs can be found in the GDC Legacy Archive.  Variants from affected aliquots appear in the protected MAFs with GDC_FILTER=ContEst to indicate a sample contamination problem, but are removed during the generation of the Somatic MAF file.  In a later release we will supply corrected BAM, VCF, and MAF files for these cases.  In the mean time, we advise you not to use any of the WXS files associated with these cases in the GDC Data Portal.  A list of these files can be found here. [Download list of affected files](DLBC_Affected_Files.txt). <!-- Data-871-->

* Some TCGA annotations are unavailable in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal<!--DAT-52-->. These annotations can be found [here](tcga-annotations-unavailable-20170315.json).
* Public MAF files for different variant calling pipelines but the same project may contain different numbers of samples.  Samples are omitted from the public MAF files if they have no PASS variants, which can lead to this apparent discrepancy.
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* No data from TARGET-MDLS is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->
* SDF Files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-332-->

## Data Release 3.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: September 16, 2016

### New updates

1.  CCLE data now available (in the Legacy Archive only)
2.  BMI calculation is corrected
3.  Slide is now categorized as a Biospecimen entity

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* BMI calculation is corrected

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Insertions called for tumor samples that underwent whole genome amplification may be of lower quality.  Whether a sample underwent this process can be found in the analyte_type property within analyte and aliquot. TCGA analyte type can be also identified in the 20th character of TCGA barcode, at which "W" corresponds to WGA.<!--BINF-6-->
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Public MAFs (those with germline variants removed) are only available for MuTect2 pipeline.  MAFs for other pipelines are forthcoming.  
* MAF Column #109 "FILTER" entries are separated by both commas and semi-colons. <!-- PGDC-2589 -->
* TARGET-AML and TARGET-ALL projects are undergoing reorganization.  Pending reorganization, cases from these projects may not contain many clinical, biospecimen, or genomic data files.
* No data from TARGET-PPTP is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->

## Data Release 2.0

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: August 9, 2016


### New updates

1.  Additional data, previously available via CGHub and the TCGA DCC, is now available in the GDC
2.  Better linking between files and their associated projects and cases in the Legacy Archive
3.  MAF files are now available in the GDC Data Portal

### Known Issues and Workarounds

* Insertions called for tumor samples that underwent whole genome amplification may be of lower quality.  These are present in VCF and MAF files produced by the MuTect2 variant calling pipeline.  This information can be found in the analyte_type property within analyte and aliquot. TCGA analyte type can be also identified in the 20th character of TCGA barcode, at which "W" corresponds to WGA.<!--BINF-6-->
* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* Public MAFs (those with germline variants removed) are only available for MuTect2 pipeline.  MAFs for other pipelines are forthcoming.  
* MAF Column #109 "FILTER" entries are separated by both commas and semi-colons. <!-- PGDC-2589 -->
* TARGET-AML and TARGET-ALL projects are undergoing reorganization.  Pending reorganization, cases from these projects may not contain many clinical, biospecimen, or genomic data files.
* No data from TARGET-PPTP is available.
* Slide barcodes (`submitter_id` values for Slide entities in the Legacy Archive) are not available <!-- DAT-10 -->
* SDF Files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-332-->
* There are 200 cases from TCGA-LAML that do not appear in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-327-->
* Biotab files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-303-->
* SDRF files are not linked to Project or Case in the Legacy Archive <!--SV-288-->
* Portion "weight" property is incorrectly described in the Data Dictionary as the weight of the patient in kg, should be described as the weight of the portion in mg <!--SV-391-->

## Initial Data Release (1.0)

* __GDC Product__: Data
* __Release Date__: June 6, 2016

### Available Program Data

* The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
* Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)

### Available Harmonized Data

* WXS
     * Co-cleaned BAM files aligned to GRCh38 using BWA
* mRNA-Seq
    * BAM files aligned to GRCh38 using STAR 2-pass strategy
    * Expression quantification using HTSeq
* miRNA-Seq
    * BAM files aligned to GRCh38 using BWA aln
    * Expression quantification using BCCA miRNA Profiling Pipeline*
* Genotyping Array
    * CNV segmentation data


### Known Issues and Workarounds

* BAM files produced by the GDC RNA-Seq Alignment workflow will currently fail validation using the Picard ValidateSamFiles tool.  This is caused by STAR2 not recording mate mapping information for unmapped reads, which are retained in our BAM files.  Importantly, all affected BAM files are known to behave normally in downstream workflows including expression quantification.
* All legacy files for TCGA are available in the GDC Legacy Archive, but not always linked back to cases depending on available metadata.
* Public MAFs (those with germline variants removed) are only available for MuTect2 pipeline.  MAFs for other pipelines are forthcoming.  
* TARGET-AML and TARGET-ALL projects are undergoing reorganization.  Pending reorganization, cases from these projects may not contain many clinical, biospecimen, or genomic data files.
* No data from TARGET-PPTP is available.
*	Legacy data not available in harmonized form:
    *	Annotated VCF files from TARGET, anticipated in future data release
    * TCGA data that failed harmonization or QC or have been newly updated in CGHub: ~1.0% of WXS aliquots, ~1.6% of RNA-Seq aliquots
    * TARGET data that failed harmonization or QC, have been newly updated in CGHub, or whose project names are undergoing reorganization: ~76% of WXS aliquots, ~49% of RNA-Seq aliquots, ~57% of miRNA-Seq.
* MAF Column #109 "FILTER" entries are separated by both commas and semi-colons. <!-- PGDC-2589 -->
*	MAFs are not yet available for query or search in the GDC Data Portal or API.  You may download these files using the following manifests, which can be passed directly to the Data Transfer Tool.  Links for the open-access TCGA MAFs are provided below for downloading individual files.
    * [Open-access MAFs manifest](Manifests/GDC_open_MAFs_manifest.txt)
    * [Controlled-access MAFs manifest](Manifests/GDC_controlled_MAFs_manifest.txt)

Details are provided in [Data Release Manifest](Manifests/GDC_Data_v1_release_notes_manifest.txt)

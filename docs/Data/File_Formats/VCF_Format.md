# GDC VCF Format

## Introduction

The GDC DNA-Seq somatic variant-calling pipeline compares a set of matched tumor/normal alignments and produces a VCF file. VCF files report the somatic variants that were detected by each of the four variant callers. Four raw VCFs (Data Type: Raw Simple Somatic Mutation) are produced for each tumor/normal pair of BAMs. Four additional annotated VCFs (Data Type: Annotated Somatic Mutation) are produced by adding biologically relevant information about each variant.  

The GDC VCF file format follows standards of the [Variant Call Format (VCF) Version 4.1 Specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf). Raw Simple Somatic Mutation VCF files are unannotated, whereas Annotated Somatic Mutation VCF files include extensive, consistent, and pipeline-agnostic annotation of somatic variants.

## VCF file structure

### Metadata header

A VCF file starts with lines of metadata that begin with `##`. Some key components of this section include:

*  __gdcWorkflow:__ Information on the pipelines that were used by the GDC to generate the VCF file. Annotated VCF files contain two *gdcWorkflow* lines, one that reports the variant calling process and one that reports the variant annotation process.
*  __INDIVIDUAL:__ information about the study participant (`case`), including:
 	* *NAME:* Submitter ID (barcode) associated with the participant
	* *ID:* GDC case UUID
*  __SAMPLE:__ sample information, including:
	*  *ID:* NORMAL or TUMOR
	*  *NAME:* Submitter ID (barcode) of the aliquot
	*  *ALIQUOT_ID:* GDC aliquot UUID
	*  *BAM_ID:* The UUID for the BAM file used to produce the VCF  
*   __INFO:__ Format of *additional information* fields
	*  NOTE: GDC Annotated VCFs may contain multiple INFO lines. The last INFO line contains information about annotation fields generated by the [Somatic Annotation Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=somatic_annotation_workflow) (see [GDC INFO Fields](#gdc-info-fields) below).
*   __FILTER:__ Description of filters that have been applied to the variants
*   __FORMAT:__ Description of genotype fields
*   __reference:__ The reference genome used to generate the VCF file (GRCh38.d1.vd1.fa)
*   __contig:__ A list of IDs for the contiguous DNA sequences that appear in the reference genome used to produce VCF files
	*  NOTE: Annotated VCFs include contig information for autosomes, sex chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. Unplaced, unlocalized, human decoy, and viral genome sequences are not included.
*   __VEP:__ the VEP command used by the [Somatic Annotation Workflow](/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=somatic_annotation_workflow) to generate the annotated VCF file.

### Column Header Line

Each variant is represented by a row in the VCF file. Below each of the columns are described:

0. __CHROM:__ The chromosome on which the variant is located
0. __POS:__ The position of the variant on the chromosome.  Refers to the first position if the variant includes more than one base
0. __ID:__ A unique identifier for the variant; usually a dbSNP rs number if applicable
0. __REF:__ The base(s) exhibited by the reference genome at the variant's position
0. __ALT:__ The alternate allele(s), comma-separated if there are more than one
0. __QUAL:__ Not populated
0. __FILTER:__ The names of the filters that have flagged this variant. The types of filters used will depend on the variant caller used.
0. __INFO:__ Additional information about the variant. This includes the annotation applied by the VEP.
0. __FORMAT:__ The format of the sample genotype data in the next two columns. This includes colon-separated values.
0. __NORMAL:__ Colon-separated values that describe the normal sample
0. __TUMOR:__ Colon-separated values that describe the tumor sample

## GDC INFO fields

The following variant annotation fields are currently included in Annotated Somatic Mutation VCF files.  Please refer to the [DNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline](../Bioinformatics_Pipelines/DNA_Seq_Variant_Calling_Pipeline.md) documentation for details on how this information is generated. [VEP Documentation](http://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/vep_formats.html#output) provides additional information about some of these fields.

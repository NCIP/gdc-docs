# Cart and File Download

## Overview

While browsing the GDC Data Portal, files can either be downloaded individually from [file detail pages](Repository.md#file-summary-page) or collected in the file cart to be downloaded as a bundle.  Clicking on the shopping cart icon that is next to any item in the GDC will add the item to your cart.

## GDC Cart

[![Cart](images/cart-overview_v2.png)](images/cart-overview_v2.png "Click to see the full image.")

### Cart Summary

The cart page shows a summary of all files currently in the cart:

* Number of files
* Number of cases associated with the files
* Total file size

The Cart page also displays two tables:

* __File count by project__: Breaks down the files and cases by each project
* __File count by authorization level__: Breaks down the files in the cart by authorization level.  A user must be logged into the GDC in order to download 'Controlled-Access files'

The cart also directs users how to download files in the cart.  For large data files, it is recommended that the GDC Data Transfer Tool be used.

### Cart Items

[![Cart](images/gdc-cart-items_v2.png)](images/gdc-cart-items_v2.png "Click to see the full image.")

The Cart Items table shows the list of all the files that were added to the Cart.  The table gives the folowing information for each file in the cart:

* __Access__: Displays whether the file is open or controlled access.  Users must login to the GDC Portal and have the appropriate credentials to access these files.
* __File Name__: Name of the file.  Clicking the link will bring the user to the file summary page.
* __Cases__: How many cases does the file contain.  Clicking the link will bring the user to the case summary page.
* __Project__: The Project that the file belongs to.  Clicking the link will bring the user to the Project summary page.
* __Category__: Type of data
* __Format__: The file format
* __Size__: The size of the file
* __Annotations__: Whether there are any annotations

## Download Options

[![Cart](images/gdc-download-options_v2.png)](images/gdc-download-options_v2.png "Click to see the full image.")

There are a few buttons on the Cart page that allow users to download files.  The following download options are available:

* __Biospecimen__: Downloads bioscpecimen data related to files in the cart in either TSV or JSON format.
* __Clinical__: Downloads clinical data related to files in the cart in either TSV or JSON format.
* __Sample Sheet__: Downloads a tab-separated file which contains the associated case/sample IDs and sample type for each file in the cart.
* __Metadata__: GDC harmonized clinical, biospecimen, and file metadata associated with the files in the cart.
* __Download Manifest__: Download a manifest file for use with the GDC Data Transfer Tool to download files.  A manifest file contains a list of the UUIDs that correspond to the files in the cart.
* __Download Cart__: Download the files in the Cart directly through the browser. Users have to be cautious of the amount of data in the cart since this option will not optimize bandwidth and will not provide resume capabilities.
* __SRA XML, MAGE-TAB__: This option is available in the GDC Legacy Archive only. It is used to download metadata files associated with the files in the cart.

The cart allows users to download up to 5 GB of data directly through the web browser. This is not recommended for downloading large volumes of data, in particular due to the absence of a retry/resume mechanism. For downloads over 5 GB we recommend using the GDC Data Transfer Tool.

__Note__: when downloading multiple files from the cart, they are automatically bundled into one single Gzipped (.tar.gz) file.

### GDC Data Transfer Tool

The `Download Manifest` button will download a manifest file that can be imported into the GDC Data Transfer Tool.   Below is an example of the contents of a manifest file used for download:

```manifest
id	filename	md5	size	state
4ea9c657-8f85-44d0-9a77-ad59cced8973	mdanderson.org_ESCA.MDA_RPPA_Core.mage-tab.1.1.0.tar.gz		2516051	live

```

The Manifest contains a list of the file UUIDs in the cart and can be used together with the GDC Data Transfer Tool to download all files.

Information on the GDC Data Transfer Tool is available in the [GDC Data Transfer Tool User's Guide](/node/8196/).

### Individual Files Download

Similar to the files page, each row contains a download button to download a particular file individually.

## Controlled Files

If a user tries to download a cart containing controlled files and without being authenticated, a pop-up will be displayed to offer the user either to download only open access files or to login into the GDC Data Portal through eRA Commons. See [Authentication](Authentication.md) for details.

# Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) #
## Introduction ##
A Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) is a center where samples are carefully catalogued, processed, quality-checked and stored 
along with participant clinical information.
## Description ##
### Overview ###
The work of a BCR includes the following important functions:
* Serve as the interface between the program and the different Tissue Source Site (TSS) collecting tumor and matched normal controls
* Ensure and verify that TCGA human subjects protections and guidelines are adhered to and that all regulations are followed at each TSS 
* Verify use of language consistent with informed consent documents
* Examine all biospecimens to ensure they meet rigorous standards for each tumor type (including percent necrosis and percent tumor nuclei)
* Review pathology to ensure accurate diagnosis and validate against inclusion criteria
* Collect clinical information for each sample and apply standardized terminology, definitions and formats that are compliant with data standards
* Extract and distribute DNA and RNA from samples to genomic characterization and sequencing centers

### Biospecimen Processing ###
After samples are collected from a TSS, a BCR ensures sample quality through a Pathology Review before extracting molecular analytes: DNA or RNA, which are in turn analysed for quality. Analytes are aliquoted and assigned aliquot barcodes by the BCR before they are sent to the other centers. The BCR sends plated DNA/RNA analytes and corresponding aliquot barcodes to Genome Characterization Centers (GCCs) for molecular characterization.

### GDC Data Submission ###
A BCR typically submits the following information to the GDC:

* Biospecimen Data (XML and TXT format)
* Clinical information (XML and TXT format)
* Tissue slide images
* Pathology Reports

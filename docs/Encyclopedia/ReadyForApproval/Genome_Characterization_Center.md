# Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub) #
## Description ##
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genome Characterization Centers (GCCs) were responsible for characterizing the genomic changes found in the tumors studied by TCGA.
## Overview ##
The Genome Characterization Centers (GCCs) were responsible for characterizing the genomic changes found in the tumors studied by TCGA. The GCCs used multiple platforms to provide data to the cancer research community on changes in microRNA and gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number changes. The GCCs also validated specific regions of interest through targeted sequencing.

The following groups, organized by area of focus, served as TCGA Genome Characterization Centers:

__Copy Number Alteration (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Characterization)__
Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass., The Broad Institute, Cambridge, Mass.

__Epigenomics__
Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, Mich.

__Gene (mRNA) Expression__
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, N.C.

__microRNA (miRNA) Analysis__
British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, B.C., Canada

__Targeted Sequencing Center__
Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas

__Functional Proteomics__
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas

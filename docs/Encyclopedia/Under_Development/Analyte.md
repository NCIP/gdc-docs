# Analyte #
## Description ##
An analyte is a chemical substance that is the focus or subject of chemical analysis.

## Overview ##
An analyte is the molecular specimen extracted for analysis from a portion using a specific extraction protocol.
It is usually of a particular molecular type. The [GDC Data Model](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-data-model/gdc-data-model-components) relates analytes to aliquots and/or portions but is not a required biospecimen entity.

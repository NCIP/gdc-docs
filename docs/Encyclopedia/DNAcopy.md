# DNAcopy #
## Description ##

DNAcopy is an R-package used to analyze copy number variation data.

## Overview ##

DNAcopy is used by the GDC to generate copy number variation (CNV) data. A circular binary segmentation analysis was performed on normalized array intensities to identify chromosomal regions with abnormal copy numbers. The result of this workflow is the harmonized [Copy Number Segment](LINK) file.

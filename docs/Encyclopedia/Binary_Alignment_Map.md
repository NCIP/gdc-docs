# Binary Alignment Map #
## Introduction ##
A Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) file is the compressed binary version of the Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM), a compact and indexable representation of nucleotide sequence alignments
## Description ##
### Overview ###
Centers align sequence reads to a reference genome to produce a Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) format file. The SAM file is then converted into a binary form, or Binary-sequence Alignment Format (BAM) file, for indexing to allow efficient random access of the data contained within.
### Structure ###
The BAM specifications and tools to use them are available for download.

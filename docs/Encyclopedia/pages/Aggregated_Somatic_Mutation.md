# Aggregated Somatic Mutation #

## Description ##
Aggregated Somatic Mutation is a file type that reports somatic mutations for all of the cases in a project and includes information associated with each mutation.

## Overview ##

Aggregated Somatic Mutation files are generated by aggregating all of the case-level annotated VCFs (each from a single case) associated with a project and variant-calling pipeline<sup>1</sup>. The GDC used a modified version of the vcf2maf script to generate aggregated somatic mutation files<sup>2,3</sup>.

### Data Formats ###

Aggregated Somatic Mutation files are available in MAF format. MAF files are tab-delimited and associate each mutation with biologically relevant data. See the GDC MAF File Format documentation for a detailed description of this file type<sup>4</sup>. Aggregated Somatic Mutation files can be downloaded from the GDC Data Portal<sup>5</sup>.

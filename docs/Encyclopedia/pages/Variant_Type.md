# Variant Type #

## Description ##
Variant callers identify multiple types of variants.  The type of variant can be reported in a VCF or MAF formatted file.

## Overview ##

Variant type is reported by the GDC MAF file in a column named `Variant_Type` (column 10)<sup>1</sup>. The following variant types are reported:

* __SNP:__ Single nucleotide polymorphism -- a substitution in one nucleotide
* __DNP:__ Double nucleotide polymorphism -- a substitution in two consecutive nucleotides
* __TNP:__ Triple nucleotide polymorphism -- a substitution in three consecutive nucleotides
* __ONP:__ Oligo-nucleotide polymorphism -- a substitution in more than three consecutive nucleotides
* __INS:__ Insertion -- the addition of nucleotides
* __DEL:__ Deletion -- the removal of  nucleotides

# Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub) #
## Description ##
The Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub) was the repository for genomic data for several NCI studies prior to the launch of the GDC.
## Overview ##
The Cancer Genomics Hub was established in August 2011 to provide a repository to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the childhood cancer initiative Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) and the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI).

The Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub) was managed by the University of California Santa Cruz and is no longer supported. This data is now migrated to and managed by the Genomic Data Commons (GDC).

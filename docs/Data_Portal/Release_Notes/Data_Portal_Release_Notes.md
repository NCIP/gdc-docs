*  Custom facet filters
    * Some definitions are missing from the property list when adding custom facet file or case filters. <!--SV-989-->
*  Visualizations
    *  SIFT and PolyPhen annotations are missing from the Export JSON of the mutation table. They are present in the export TSV. <!--PRTL-1990-->
    *  Data Portal graphs cannot be exported as PNG images in Internet Explorer. Graphs can be exported in PNG or SVG format from Chrome or Firefox browsers <!-- PRTL-1325 / PRTL-1114 -->. Internet Explorer does not display chart legend and title when re-opening previously downloaded SVG files, the recommendation is to open downloaded SVG files with another program.
*  Repository and Cart
    *  The annotation count in File table of Repository and Cart does not link to the Annotations page anymore. The user can navigate to the annotations through the annotation count in Repository - Case table.
*  Legacy Archive
    *	Downloading a token in the GDC Legacy Archive does not refresh it. If a user downloads a token in the GDC Data Portal and then attempts to download a token in the GDC Legacy Archive, an old token may be provided. Reloading the Legacy Archive view will allow the user to download the updated token.
    *	Exporting the Cart table in JSON will export the GDC Archive file table instead of exporting the files in the Cart only. <!-- LGCY-81 -->
*   Web Browsers
    *   Browsers limit the number of concurrent downloads, it is generally recommended to add files to the cart and download large number of files through the GDC Data Transfer Tool, more details can be found on [GDC Website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-faqs).
    *   The GDC Portals are not compatible with Internet Explorer running in compatibility mode. Workaround is to disable compatibility mode. <!-- PGDC-2480 -->

## Release 1.8.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: August 22, 2017

### New Features and Changes

Major features/changes:

* A feature that links the exploration and repository pages was added. For example:
    - In the exploration page, cases with a specific mutation could be selected. This set could then be linked to the repository page to download the data files associated with these cases.
    - In the repository menu, the user can select cases associated with specific files. The set could then be linked to exploration page to view the variants associated with this set of cases.

*  Users can now upload a custom gene list to the exploration page and leverage the GDC search and visualization features for cases and variants associated with the gene set.

*  Filters added for the gene entity page. For example:
    - Clicking on a mutated gene from the project page will display mutations associated with the gene that are present in this project (filtered protein viewer, etc.).
    - Clicking on a mutated gene from the exploration page will display the mutations associated with the gene filtered by additional search criteria, such as "primary site is Kidney and mutation impact is high".

* UUIDs are now hidden from tables and charts to simplify readability. The UUIDs can still be exported and viewed in the tables using the "arrange columns" feature. In the mutation table, UUIDs are automatically exported.

* Mutation entity page - one consequence per transcript is shown (10 rows by default) in the consequence table. The user should display all rows before exporting the table.

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release
*  Exploration
    *  Combining "Variant Caller" mutation filter with a case filter will display incorrect counts in the mutation facet. The number of mutations in the resulting mutation table is correct. <!-- API-307 -->
    *  Mutation table: it is difficult to click on the denominator in "#Affected Cases in Cohort" column displayed to the left side of the bar. The user should click at a specific position at the top of the number to be able to go to the corresponding link. <!-- PRTL-1377 -->


### Known Issues and Workarounds
*  Visualizations
    *  Data Portal graphs cannot be exported as PNG images in Internet Explorer. Graphs can be exported in PNG or SVG format from Chrome or Firefox browsers <!-- PRTL-1325 / PRTL-1114 -->. Internet Explorer does not display chart legend and title when re-opening previously downloaded SVG files, the recommendation is to open downloaded SVG files with another program.

## Release 1.6.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: June 29, 2017

### New Features and Changes

There was a major new release of the GDC Data Portal focused on Data Analysis, Visualization, and Exploration (DAVE). Some important new features include the following:

*  New visual for the Homepage: a human body provides the number of Cases per Primary Site with a link to an advanced Cancer Projects search
*  The Projects menu provides the Top 20 Cancer Genes across the GDC Projects and the Case Distribution per Project
*  A new menu "Exploration" is an advanced Cancer Projects search which provides the ability to apply Case, Gene, and Mutation filters to look for:
    * List of Cases with the largest number of Somatic Mutations
    *	The most frequently mutated Genes
    *	The most frequent Variants
    *	Oncogrid view of mutation frequency
*  Visualizations are provided across the Project, Case, Gene and Mutation entity pages:
    *	List of most frequently mutated genes and most frequent variants
    *	Survival plots for patients with or without specific variants
    *	Survival plots for patients with or without variants in specific genes
    *	Lollipop plots of mutation frequency across protein domains
*  Links to external databases (COSMIC, dbSNP, Uniprot, Ensembl, OMIM, HGNC)
*  Quick Search for Gene and Mutation entity pages
*  The ability to export the current view of a table in TSV
*  Retired GDC cBioPortal

_For detailed updates please review the [Data Portal User Guide](../Data_Portal/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/)._

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

*  BAM Slicing dialog box does not disappear automatically upon executing the BAM slicing function. The box can be closed manually. <!-- PRTL-282 -->
*  Very long URLs will produce a 400 error.  Users may encounter this after clicking on "source files" on a file page where the target file is derived from hundreds of other files such as for MAF files. <!-- SV-396 / PRTL-342-->
*  If bam slicing produces an error pop-up message it will be obscured behind the original dialog box. <!--SV-419-->
    *   Internet Explorer users are not able to use the "Only show fields with no values" when adding custom facets <!-- PGDC-2467 / PRTL-109 -->
    *   Exporting large tables in the Data Portal may produce a 500 error.  Filtering this list to include fewer cases or files should eliminate the error <!--API-223-->    

### Known Issues and Workarounds
*  New Visualizations
    *  Cannot export Data Portal graphs in PNG in Internet Explorer. Graphs can be exported to PNG or SVG from Chrome or Firefox browsers <!-- PRTL-1325 / PRTL-1114 -->. Internet would not display chart legend and title when re-opening previously downloaded SVG files, recommendation is to open downloaded SVG files with another software.
    *  In the protein viewer there may be overlapping mutations.  In this case mousing over a point will just show a single mutation and the other mutations at this location will not be apparent.  <!--SV-750-->
*  Exploration
    *  Combining "Variant Caller" mutation filter with a case filter will display wrong counts in the mutation facet. The number of mutations in the result mutation table is correct. <!-- API-307 -->
    *  Mutation table: it is difficult to click on the denominator in "#Affected Cases in Cohort" column displayed to the left side of the bar. The user should click at a specific position at the top of the number to be able to go to the corresponding link. <!-- PRTL-1377 -->
*  Entity page
    *  On the mutation entity page, in the Consequences Table, the "Coding DNA Change" column is not populated for rows that do not correspond to the canonical mutation. <!-- SV-751 -->
*  Repository and Cart
    *  The annotation count in File table of Repository and Cart does not link to the Annotations page anymore. The user can navigate to the annotations through the annotation count in Repository - Case table.
*  Legacy Archive
    *	Downloading a token in the GDC Legacy Archive does not refresh it. If a user downloads a token in the GDC Data Portal and then attempts to download a token in the GDC Legacy Archive, an old token may be provided. Reloading the Legacy Archive view will allow the user to download the updated token.
    *	Exporting the Cart table in JSON will export the GDC Archive file table instead of exporting the files in the Cart only.
*   Web Browsers
    *   Browsers limit the number of concurrent downloads, it is generally recommended to add files to the cart and download large number of files through the GDC Data Transfer Tool, more details can be found on [GDC Website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-faqs).
    *   The GDC Portals are not compatible with Internet Explorer running in compatibility mode. Workaround is to disable compatibility mode. <!-- PGDC-2480 -->

## Release 1.3.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: September 7, 2016

### New Features and Changes

*   A new "Metadata" button on the cart page to download merged clinical, biospecimen, and file metadata in a single consolidated JSON file. **May require clearing browser cache** <!-- PRTL-177 -->
*   Added a banner on the Data Portal to help users find data <!-- PRTL-237 -->
*   Added support for "Enter" key on login button <!-- PRTL-136 -->
*   On the Data page, the browser will remember which facet tab was selected when hitting the "Back" button <!-- PRTL-147 -->
*   In file entity page, if there is a link to one single file, redirect to this file's entity page instead of a list page.  <!-- PRTL-75 -->


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* 	Adding a mix of open and controlled files to the cart from any Case entity pages was creating authorization issues <!-- PRTL-226 -->
*  Opening multiple browser tabs and adding files in those browser tabs was not refreshing the cart in other tabs. <!-- PRTL-181 -->
*   When user logs in from the advanced search page, the login popup does not automatically close <!-- PRTL-88 -->
*   When removing a file from the cart and clicking undo, GDC loses track of permission status of the user towards this file and will ask for the user to log-in again. <!-- PGDC-2496 -->
*   Download File Metadata button produces incomplete JSON output omitting such fields as file_name and submitter_id.  The current workaround includes using the API to return file metadata. <!-- SV-359 / PRTL-177 -->    
*   Annotations notes do not wrap to the next line at the beginning or the end of a word, some words might be split in two lines <!-- PGDC-2474 / PRTL-182-->   
*   Sorting annotations by Case UUID causes error <!-- PRTL-95 -->   

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*   General
    *   When no filters are engaged in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal, clicking the Download Manifest button may produce a 500 error and the message "We are currently experiencing issues. Please try again later.".  To avoid this error the user can first filter by files or cases to reduce the number files added to the manifest.
    *   After successful authentication, the authentication popup does not close for Internet Explorer users running in "Compatibility View". Workaround is to uncheck "Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View" in Internet Explorer options. Alternatively, refreshing the portal will correctly display authentication status. <!-- PGDC-2403 / PRTL-133 -->
    *   BAM Slicing dialog box does not disappear automatically upon executing the BAM slicing function. The box can be closed manually. <!-- PRTL-282 -->

# Data Portal Release Notes


## Release 1.4.2

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: April 27, 2017

### New Features and Changes

* Removed link to Data Download Statistics Report <!--PRTL-1081-->
* Updated version numbers of API, GDC Data Portal, and Data Release

### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

*  None

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*   General
    *   Exporting large tables in the Data Portal may produce a 500 error.  Filtering this list to include fewer cases or files should eliminate the error <!--API-223-->
    *   After successful authentication, the authentication popup does not close for Internet Explorer users running in "Compatibility View". Workaround is to uncheck "Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View" in Internet Explorer options. Alternatively, refreshing the portal will correctly display authentication status. <!-- PGDC-2403 / PRTL-133 -->
    *   BAM Slicing dialog box does not disappear automatically upon executing the BAM slicing function. The box can be closed manually. <!-- PRTL-282 -->
    *   Due to preceding issue, If bam slicing produces an error pop-up message it will be obscured behind the original dialog box. <!--SV-419-->
    *   Very long URLs will produce a 400 error.  Users may encounter this after clicking on "source files" on a file page where the target file is derived from hundreds of other files such as for MAF files.  To produce a list of source files an API call can be used with the search parameter "fields=analysis.input_files.file_name". <!-- SV-396 / PRTL-342-->
		*   Downloading a token in the GDC Legacy Archive does not refresh it. If a user downloads a token in the GDC Data Portal and then attempts to download a token in the GDC Legacy Archive, an old token may be provided. Reloading the Legacy Archive view will allow the user to download the updated token.

*   Cart
    *   Counts displayed in the top right of the screen, next to the Cart icon, may become inconsistent if files are removed from the server. <!-- PGDC-2403 / PRTL-133 -->
*   Web Browsers
    *   Browsers limit the number of concurrent downloads, it is generally recommended to add files to the cart and download large number of files through the GDC Data Transfer Tool, more details can be found on [GDC Website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/gdc-faqs).
    *   Internet Explorer users are not able to use the "Only show fields with no values" when adding custom facets <!-- PGDC-2467 / PRTL-109 -->
    *   The GDC Portals are not compatible with Internet Explorer running in compatibility mode. Workaround is to disable compatibility mode. <!-- PGDC-2480 -->

## Release 1.3.0

* __GDC Product__: GDC Data Portal
* __Release Date__: September 7, 2016

### New Features and Changes

*   A new "Metadata" button on the cart page to download merged clinical, biospecimen, and file metadata in a single consolidated JSON file. **May require clearing browser cache** <!-- PRTL-177 -->
*   Added a banner on the Data Portal to help users find data <!-- PRTL-237 -->
*   Added support for "Enter" key on login button <!-- PRTL-136 -->
*   On the Data page, the browser will remember which facet tab was selected when hitting the "Back" button <!-- PRTL-147 -->
*   In file entity page, if there is a link to one single file, redirect to this file's entity page instead of a list page.  <!-- PRTL-75 -->


### Bugs Fixed Since Last Release

* 	Adding a mix of open and controlled files to the cart from any Case entity pages was creating authorization issues <!-- PRTL-226 -->
*  Opening multiple browser tabs and adding files in those browser tabs was not refreshing the cart in other tabs. <!-- PRTL-181 -->
*   When user logs in from the advanced search page, the login popup does not automatically close <!-- PRTL-88 -->
*   When removing a file from the cart and clicking undo, GDC loses track of permission status of the user towards this file and will ask for the user to log-in again. <!-- PGDC-2496 -->
*   Download File Metadata button produces incomplete JSON output omitting such fields as file_name and submitter_id.  The current workaround includes using the API to return file metadata. <!-- SV-359 / PRTL-177 -->    
*   Annotations notes do not wrap to the next line at the beginning or the end of a word, some words might be split in two lines <!-- PGDC-2474 / PRTL-182-->   
*   Sorting annotations by Case UUID causes error <!-- PRTL-95 -->   

### Known Issues and Workarounds

*   General
    *   When no filters are engaged in the Legacy Archive or Data Portal, clicking the Download Manifest button may produce a 500 error and the message "We are currently experiencing issues. Please try again later.".  To avoid this error the user can first filter by files or cases to reduce the number files added to the manifest.
    *   After successful authentication, the authentication popup does not close for Internet Explorer users running in "Compatibility View". Workaround is to uncheck "Display Intranet sites in Compatibility View" in Internet Explorer options. Alternatively, refreshing the portal will correctly display authentication status. <!-- PGDC-2403 / PRTL-133 -->
    *   BAM Slicing dialog box does not disappear automatically upon executing the BAM slicing function. The box can be closed manually. <!-- PRTL-282 -->
    *   Due to preceding issue, If bam slicing produces an error pop-up message it will be obscured behind the original dialog box. <!--SV-419-->
    *   Very long URLs will produce a 400 error.

To produce a list of source files an API call can be used with the search parameter "fields=analysis.input_files.file_name". <!-- SV-396 -->
    *   On the Legacy Archive, searches for "Case Submitter ID Prefix" containing special characters are not displayed correctly above the result list. The result list is correct, however. <!--SV-412 / LGCY-33-->

# Quick Start Page

The purpose of this guide is to quickly introduce researchers to the GDC Data Portal. This is not a comprehensive overview of the Data Portal. Please see the rest of the Data Portal documentation pages for information about specific tools.

Start at [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

## Building and Analyzing a Cohort

__Step 1:__ Go to the Cohort Builder at the top left of the Data Portal.

__Step 2:__ Use the filters in the Cohort Builder to filter down the full set of GDC cases to a subset you are interested in. Filter categories can be selected in the left panel.

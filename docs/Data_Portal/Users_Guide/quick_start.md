# Quick Start Page

The purpose of this guide is to quickly introduce researchers to the GDC Data Portal. This is not a comprehensive overview of the Data Portal and may not contain details for your specific use-case. Please see the rest of the Data Portal documentation pages for information about specific tools.

Start at [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

### Building and Analyzing a Cohort


__Step 1:__ Go to the Cohort Builder at the top left of the Data Portal.

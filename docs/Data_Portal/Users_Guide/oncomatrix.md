# OncoMatrix

## Introduction to OncoMatrix

The GDC OncoMatrix is a handy tool to visualize coding mutations (Simple Somatic Mutations, or SSM) and copy number variations (here onward referred to as CNV).
Each row is a gene and each cell, or a column represents a case. At any point in the tutorial, hover over a symbol or icon for two-three seconds to display more information about that icon.

## Accessing the Matrix Chart

At the Analysis Center, click on the "OncoMatrix" card to launch the app.

## OncoMatrix Features

The following features are viewable once the matrix application is loaded.
There are three main panels as outlined in the figure below i.e., the `Control panel`, `Matrix chart`, and the `Legend panel`.

[![Oncomatrix chart overview](./images/oncomatrix/2-entire_matrix.png)](./images/oncomatrix/2-entire_matrix.png 'Click to see the full image.')

Each of the features and functionalities are described in detail in the following sections.

## Matrix plot

### Hovering on sample columns

Each column in the matrix represents a sample.
Hover over sample cells/columns to display information about the sample such as case id, gene name, Copy number information and mutation/mutation class (if any provided) as shown below.

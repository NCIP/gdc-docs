### Matrix Plot

The OncoMatrix plot displays the genes along the left panel with each column representing a case.

#### Matrix cells

Each column in the matrix represents a case. Hovering over a cell will display the corresponding case submitter_id, gene name, copy number information, and mutation class if any are provided. Clicking on a cell also gives users the option to launch the Disco Plot.

[![Disco Plot button](images/oncomatrix_disco_plot_button.png)](images/oncomatrix_disco_plot_button.png 'Click to see the full image.')

The Disco Plot is a circular plot that shows all the mutations and CNVs for a given case. The Disco Plot also displays the legend for the mutation class and the CNV.

[![Disco Plot](images/oncomatrix_disco_plot.png)](images/oncomatrix_disco_plot.png 'Click to see the full image.')

#### Automatic Zoom

To perform an automatic zoom, users can click on and hold a case column then drag the mouse from left to right to form a zoom boundary. From the pop-up window, users can choose to zoom in to the cases, list all highlighted cases, or create a cohort of the selected cases.

[![Dragging and zooming on case columns](images/oncomatrix_zoom.png)](images/oncomatrix_zoom.png 'Click to see the full image.')

The individual case columns are now visible with a demarcated boundary. Above the cases, a slider has been provided for moving from one view to another to accommodate all cases.

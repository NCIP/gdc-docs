# Gene Expression Clustering Tool

## Introduction to Gene Expression Clustering

The Gene Expression Clustering tool is a web-based tool for performing sample clustering by selecting a desired set of genes from the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and visualizing a heatmap of a z-score transformed matrix.

## Quick Reference Guide

At the Analysis Center, click the 'Gene Expression Clustering' card to launch the heatmap.

[![Analysis Center Gene Expression Clustering Card](images/analysis_center_GEC_tool.png)](images/analysis_center_GEC_tool.png "Click to see the full image.")

Users can view publicly available genes as well as login with credentials to access controlled data.

There are four main panels in the Gene Expression Clustering tool: [controls](#Controls), [heatmap](#Heatmap), [variables](#Variables), and [legend](#Legend).

### Heatmap

The Gene Expression Clustering heatmap displays the active cohort's cases along the top horizontally, genes along the left column, and the z-score transformed gene expression value.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Heatmap](images/GEC_tool_heatmap.png)](images/GEC_tool_heatmap.png "Click to see the full image.")

Hovering over a cell in the heatmap displays the case submitter_id, gene name, and gene expression value.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Heatmap Cell](images/GEC_tool_cell.png)](images/GEC_tool_cell.png "Click to see the full image.")

Clicking on a cell also gives users the option to launch the [Disco plot](oncomatrix.md#disco-plot), a circos plot displaying copy number data and consequences for that case.

#### Selecting cases on the cluster

Cases on the cluster can be selected by clicking on the dendrogram. Once part of the dendrogram is selected, users can choose to zoom in to the cases, list all highlighted cases, or create a cohort of the selected cases.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Heatmap Cases Dendrogram](images/GEC_tool_heatmap_cases.png)](images/GEC_tool_heatmap_cases.png "Click to see the full image.")

Click on a case in the dendrogram to showcase the Disco plot or the GDC [Case Summary Page](getting_started.md#cohort-case-table).

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Heatmap Case Selection](images/GEC_tool_heatmap_case_selection.png)](images/GEC_tool_heatmap_case_selection.png "Click to see the full image.")

In the column of genes on the left, click on a gene to rename it, launch the [ProteinPaint Lollipop plot](proteinpaint_lollipop.md), display the GDC [Gene Summary Page](mutation_frequency.md#gene-and-mutation-summary-pages), or remove the gene. The lollipop plot displays all cases across the GDC affected by SSMs in the selected gene.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Gene Selection](images/GEC_tool_gene.png)](images/GEC_tool_gene.png "Click to see the full image.")

### Variables

Any variables added to the matrix appear below the heatmap. Users can hover over a cell to display the case submitter_id and their value for the given variable.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Variables](images/GEC_tool_variables.png)](images/GEC_tool_variables.png "Click to see the full image.")

Click on a variable to rename it, edit it by excluding categories, replace it with a different variable, or remove it entirely.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Variable Selection](images/GEC_tool_variable_selection.png)](images/GEC_tool_variable_selection.png "Click to see the full image.")

### Legend

In addition to the color coding system for the gene expression values, the legend displays the number of cases from the active cohort in each category for all variables that are selected to appear in the matrix.

[![Gene Expression Clustering Tool Legend](images/GEC_tool_legend.png)](images/GEC_tool_legend.png "Click to see the full image.")

Users can click on a variable in the legend to hide a specific category, only show a specific category, or show all categories for the selected variable.

## Features

The following features are viewable once the default heatmap is loaded. The default heatmap shows all the glioma cases. There are four main panels as outlined in the figure i.e., the 'Controls', 'Heatmap', 'Variables' and the 'Legend'. Each of the features and functionalities are described in detail in the following sections.

[![Default view](./images/geneexpclust/2-default-view.png)](./images/geneexpclust/2-default-view.png 'Click to see the full image.')

## Controls

The control panel as shown has various functionalities with which users can change or modify the appearance of the matrix. The control panel provides flexibility and a wide range of options to maximize user control.

[![Controls](./images/geneexpclust/3-controls.png)](./images/geneexpclust/3-controls.png 'Click to see the full image.')

### Clustering

The clustering control button provides several options to modify the default clustering of the heatmap. Click on the button labeled 'Clustering' to display a menu with options as shown.

[![Clustering button](./images/geneexpclust/4-clustering-control.png)](./images/geneexpclust/4-clustering-control.png 'Click to see the full image.')

#### Clustering method

Click on the 'Complete' option as highlighted to change the method of clustering. The heatmap will render again to show the complete clustering method.

[![Complete clustering method](./images/geneexpclust/5-clustering-method.png)](./images/geneexpclust/5-clustering-method.png 'Click to see the full image.')

The maximum height of the column dendrogram is shown in the next highlighted option as shown.

[![Dendrogram height](./images/geneexpclust/6-col-dendrogram-height.png)](./images/geneexpclust/6-col-dendrogram-height.png 'Click to see the full image.')

Click or edit the number in the input box to adjust the height of the column dendrograms as shown.

[![Adjusting column dendrogram height](./images/geneexpclust/7-adj-dend-height.png)](./images/geneexpclust/7-adj-dend-height.png 'Click to see the full image.')

#### Row Dendrogram Width

[![Adjusting row dendrogram width](./images/geneexpclust/8-row-dend-height.png)](./images/geneexpclust/8-row-dend-height.png 'Click to see the full image.')

[![Adjusting row dendrogram width](./images/geneexpclust/9-adj-row-dend-height.png)](./images/geneexpclust/9-adj-row-dend-height.png 'Click to see the full image.')

#### Z-score Cap

Z scores are used to compare gene expression across samples. A Z-score of zero indicates that the gene's expression level is the same as the mean expression level across all samples, while a positive Z-score indicates that the gene is expressed at a higher level than the mean, and a negative Z-score indicates that the gene is expressed at a lower level than the mean.

User can increase or decrease the Z-score Capping. Increase the Z-score cap from 5 to 10 as shown. Samples with lower gene expression gets lighter to allow highlighting of clusters with higher expression values as shown in red in the heatmap.

[![Z-score capping](./images/geneexpclust/10-zscore-cap.png)](./images/geneexpclust/10-zscore-capt.png 'Click to see the full image.')

### Cases

#### Adjusting the zoom using the zoom buttons

# Mutation Frequency

The Mutation Frequency tool visualizes the most frequently mutated genes and the most frequent somatic mutations for the active cohort. To launch the Mutation Frequency tool, click on its card from the Tools section of the Analysis Center.

[![Mutation Frequency](images/MutationFrequency.png)](images/MutationFrequency.png "Click to see the full image.")

This tool includes the following visualizations:

## Mutated Genes Histogram

The most frequently mutated genes are represented with a histogram that shows the percentage of cases affected within the active cohort. The histogram can be downloaded as an image (SVG/PNG) or raw data (JSON) using the button at the top right of the graphic.

[![Mutation Table](images/MutHisto.png)](images/MutHisto.png "Click to see the full image.")

## Survival Plot for Mutated Genes and Mutations

The mutation frequency survival plot is represented with two Kaplan-Meier curves based on cases with and without a specific mutation or mutated gene. Cases for both curves can be further filtered using the various filters available in the left panel of the Mutation Frequency tool. For example, selecting "high" for the VEP impact filter will limit the cases in both curves to those whose mutations have a high VEP impact.

The Log-Rank Test p-value is also displayed here. The survival plot can be downloaded as an image (SVG/PNG) or raw data (JSON/TSV) and the view can be reset using the buttons at the top right of the graphic.

## Genes/Mutations Table

The genes/mutations table displays the most frequently mutated genes or the most frequent mutations in the active cohort by percent frequency in descending order. Additional columns show CNV information as well as the number of affected cases. The "Cohort" toggle can be used to filter the current cohort by a specific gene or mutation, and the "Survival" button allows the user to modify the survival plot. The red arrow button allows for the percentage of affected cases to be displayed on a project-level. The data displayed in the table can be exported as a TSV using the button at the top left of the table. Additional cohorts can be created using buttons located within the table.

[![Mutation Table](images/MutationTableWithButtons.png)](images/MutationTableWithButtons.png "Click to see the full image.")

The table can be searched using the field at the top right of the table.

[![Mutation Search](images/MutSearchWithButtons.png)](images/MutSearchWithButtons.png "Click to see the full image.")

Additionally, clicking the button in the "# Mutations" column within the genes table will automatically apply a search for the corresponding gene in the mutations table. This is a convenient way to view the specific mutations in a given gene.

### Gene and Mutation Summary Pages

Users can click on the Symbol links in the Genes Table and the DNA Change links in the Mutations Table to view the Gene and Mutation Summary Pages, respectively. These pages display information about specific genes and mutations, along with visualizations and data showcasing the relationship between themselves, the projects, and cases within the GDC. The gene and mutation data that is visualized on these pages are produced from the Open-Access MAF files available for download on the GDC Portal.

Gene Summary Pages describe each gene with mutation data and provide results related to the analyses that are performed on these genes.

A table and two bar graphs (one for mutations, one for CNV events) show how many cases are affected by mutations and CNV events within the gene as a ratio and percentage. Each row/bar represents the number of cases for each project.  The final column in the table lists the number of unique mutations observed on the gene for each project.

## Custom Gene and Mutation Filters

[![Custom Gene/Mutation Filters](images/CustomGeneMutationFilters.png)](images/CustomGeneMutationFilters.png "Click to see the full image.")

The `+ Add Custom Gene Filters` button in the left panel of the Mutation Frequency tool allows users to filter mutation frequency by genes. Users can enter unique identifiers (i.e. gene symbols, gene IDs, etc.) directly into the text box as a plain text list or upload a list of unique identifiers as a CSV, TSV, or TXT file. Users can hover over the orange (i) to verify accepted gene identifiers, delimiters, and file formats.
